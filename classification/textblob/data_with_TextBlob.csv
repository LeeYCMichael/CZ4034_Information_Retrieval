But they're diluting it by putting out poor films with poor scripts.

Honestly, I'm amazed they didn't go with the most obvious plot given the premise. A sort of Pacific Rim type film, where human society has cordoned itself off from the threat of dinosaurs, learned to live with that, with that status quo collapsing when dinosaurs break into human spaces.

If not that, then an Escape From New York kind of premise, having to rescue people from a one of the many long abandoned metropolitans now totally overrun with dinosaurs, with recognisable spaces like Times Square or Brooklyn or whatever totally crumbling. 

That would be interesting and it's always fun to imagine currently civilized spaces gone to seed.

Absolutely gorgeous, immersive and cohesive in a way that I don't think any CGI dominated movie has ever achieved before. For most of the movie I felt like I was watching a nature documentary about a planet that doesn't exist. For that reason alone it's an amazing movie-going experience.

The plot is serviceable, but on the weaker side. It's not surprising, considering how many disparate elements and characters are in it, but it gets bogged down by having so many balls to juggle - especially the stuff about the whales, which gets introduced like 90 minutes into the movie. In some ways, it has the feeling of an overly faithful book adaptation. The first movie, in comparison, was a lot more stream-lined with a very simple plot. I understand what they were going for in the main story (Jake learning the costly lesson that running away won't protect his family, echoed in the tulkun's way of pacifism that likewise is doomed to fail), but perhaps it could have been tightened up a wee bit.

I was a bit confused by Spider, particularly after he gets captured. His loyalty to the Na'vi is clear, yet he feels oddly passive and sometimes even helpful when he's with Quaritch and his team, and as well on the whaling ship. Maybe I need to rewatch it to see if I missed anything, but it just struck me as odd - like an Oblivion NPC that goes into their ""Well met!"" polite greeting right after a deadly encounter. Another negative for me is Jemaine Clement, just because his short screen time was spent on spelling out the theme of exploitation so bluntly - it was very ham-fisted. Other than that, the characters were great!

Overall, it's the first time in long while I've had a truly exciting time at the cinema (last movie was the dreadful Jurassic World: Dominion, ugh) and I'm seriously contemplating going to see it again. 9/10",2/1/2023 21:55,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.4503858024691359,0,0.07444885361552028,1.0

More multiverse exploration. 

More time to connect to America, and make Stephan have more time to learn his lesson... Rather than have it be such a quick turn around. 

More time to explore the lore of chithon, the book of vishanti, the darkhold etc. 

More time with the Illuminati... 

A longer, slower, more subtle reveal of Wanda's corruption. 

Time to discuss incursions more and set up secret wars a little better... 

More Bruce Campbell cameos in every multiverse.

This was just a really boring Marvel imo. I really enjoyed the Spiderman No Way Home and the latest Thor was good solely because of Christian Bale, but I tried twice to enjoy Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness and it just wasn't too entertaining to me.

That + racism = more backlash for Black Panther while Top Gun: Maverick gets praised.

Also its worth noting that a lot of academy voters are older and Top Gun: Maverick is the kind of shit that they love in comparison to a sci fi superhero film like Black Panther",8/2/2023 7:04,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.4915384615384616,0,0.2923717948717948,1.0

Turning Red seems to be on its way to becoming a ""classic"" Pixar film. There is a groundswell of support for this movie from many critics and tons of fans. Disney completely bungled this release, and seems to be kneecapping Pixar by not releasing their films theatrically.

I don't know why Turning Red seems to be polarizing outside the fact that some people find puberty ""icky,"" even if we all go through it in our own different ways.

I'd love to see the Best Animated feature race to be more than a Pixar award, and hope it goes to something like Marcel, Pinocchio, or Puss n Boots, but I think folks are overexaggerating based on two mediocre releases and PnB being an unexpected smash hit.

Of all of these, I'd say The Batman, SS, and Joker are a tier above the others, with The Batman being my personal best. The Batman was definitely really good, but I have it a notch below TDK, so by my calculus, The Flash ""only"" needs to be close to that good.

What is so bad about Morbius and why do people hate on it so much?

I saw it and thought it was pretty decent, and that the only real issue was that they did not spend enough time on the villain, on making us see why he decided to be the way he was. 

They should have had a few more scenes of him being bullied or abused or slowly developing more of a hate for humanity or those how saw him as weak or crippled. Matt Smith was enjoyable to watch as a bad guy just running amok doing whatever he wanted.

The movie wasn't terrible, I've seen far worse. So what's the deal here?  

It wasn't the greatest film by any means but definitely an enjoyable popcorn action movie. I liked all the bat and flying around special effects. I thought it was overall decent. 

I dunno, but I enjoyed it far more then the recent MCU films like Eternals and Sheng chi or whatever that one was called. I thought it was better then Venom 2 at least.",25/1/2023 04:06,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5945028011204481,1,0.060749299719887975,1.0

It seems to me that most of the major blockbuster films overuse green screens rather than using practical sets and props. 

Thats one reason why I liked Ghostbusters Afterlife. CGI wasnt too great but it relied more on practical effects. 

In contrast, I thought the CGI in the Fantastic Beasts movies was pretty awful on the creatures. Newt looks like hes trying to pet a bird or something but his hand is still kind of in mid air. It never looked like the creatures were even there. 

I think it was the result of a bad composite shot or something like that. I mostly chalked it up to a very limited time frame to get the effects done.

The basic story of the first book is somewhat easily understood but the overarching story that ist hinted in the first book will get only a few sentences in this movie, which is understandable but it means that there are important moments one can miss.   
The beginning can get somewhat confusing for some moviegoers because the movie has to introduce a lot of the political players and the way the universe works in this story. I think the movie did a great job but one has to give every moment of this movie their full attention and that is not a given with every type of moviegoer.  


The book gives you a ton of more details and you'll understand more of what is happening in the background of the story on the planet Dune but i don't think you have to read the book before seeing the movie, it is very faithful to the story and only took somewhat superficial liberties here and there.

Scott Cooper has proven he is a good director with good films like Crazy Heart, Black Mass, and Hostiles which in my opinion are really underappreciated and rarely spoken about. His previous work Antlers was honestly pretty bad and The Pale Blue Eye despite having amazing camera work and an interesting concept, it was a slog. I love period piece stories and the idea of investigating a series of murders with Edgar Allen Poe is a cool concept and it could have been interesting. Unfortunately the narrative barely takes full advantage of its creative ideas since the story felt wooden and ends up being messy which made me doze off at certain moments. Despite having a strong start, the messy narrative and direction doesnt make the film better and makes the film uneven and sloppy. Surprisingly, I don't know if its just me. Despite having a great cast, the performances are a mix of good and bad. Some performances like Christian Bale and Gillian Anderson were really great but others felt wooden or extremely silly. 

The production, camerawork, and soundtrack is great. Some dialogue moments were pretty good. But the positive moments are overshadowed by the negatives. Cooper proves that he has some great directing talents but its unfortunate that there are a lot of wasted opportunities that could make the story much more interesting and the characters as well.

There's nothing crazy about The French Dispatch compared to his other recent works. If people dislike the seperate stories approach, so be it, but to say it's pretentious and terrible is more a commentary on Wes than the movie itself.

In short, don't rely on reactionary Redditors to tell you what is and what isn't good. If you like Wes, you'll at least be okay with this movie. I can see people saying it's not his best, but to say it's terrible is just plain wrong. From scene to scene, it's got all the classic Anderson traits, and you either like that or you don't.

The sci-fi story is simply stupid. It if wasn't for the other fluff people would be mocking it for having screws on the inside of force field containment boxes or the moronic tech solutions that somehow show the cleverness of the family.

- Ron's Gone Wrong - 4/5

I haven't watched Nightcrawler since it came out on Blu-Ray in early 2015. Man, I forgot just how well Jake Gyllenhaal played a creepy and psychotic/sociopathic character. Just watching him be a walking textbook for business and management, yet missing the all important ability to actually connect and empathize with others is kind of disturbing. The addition of Riz Ahmed was definitely a bonus. Highly recommended!!!

Ron's Gone Wrong was quite surprising. It started off a bit cheesy, but quickly established itself for what it is. I think it did a good job of showing how social media addiction can affect everyone, especially younger pre-teens and teens. Some pretty hilarious parts as well.

I loved Thunder Road. It's what you want out of a film. Make you laugh and kind of feel. When he goes to see his ex for the last time... Hilarious. 

The Wolf of Snow Hollow was a fun watch. It cracked me up. When he says ""We're going to need the phone records"" and rips the whole phone off the desk, wraps the cord around it and walks away. You can see his influences shine there.

Kills just feels like 2 hours of nothing with a series of nonsensical random things happening and characters rattling off philosophical gibberish.

Halloween Ends was a major improvement. I liked it quite a bit except for the ending. I thought simply killing off Corey in a massively anticlimactic way and making it just another Laurie vs. Michael fight was a huge mistake. Because it essentially renders his entire plot line pointless and since his plot line is the main focus of the film. It makes the entire movie feel pointless by extension. Which significantly hurts its rewatch value in my opinion. But take that ending out, the rest of film is honestly very strong. Making the botched ending even more unfortunate.",5/1/2023 14:04,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5535615079365079,1,0.0934375,1.0

They had such cool characters to begin with, and two great actors to back that up, but it was still a shit-show. The main problem I had with the movie was that there was no intense fight between Venom and Carnage. Sure, there was one. But it was not enough. I expected more mayhem, more destruction, and even a stronger bond between Tom Hardy and Symbiote. 

But no, the only motivation they had going for him is that he can eat as many people as he wants. That's a fuckin' joke, if you ask me.

They should have shown a brutal fight between Carnage and Venom in which Venom loses and then prepares himself for another standoff and would have completely obliterated Carnage.

Encapsulated everything about the character and the series. I was really excited watching in theaters.

There was more development on Daniel Craig's version with new vulnerability and growth. The Bond villain was perfectly deranged finally bringing the end-of-the-world stakes to Craig's tenure. Felix's appearance held weight, and felt climactic. Seydoux's character was a-more-than-great Bond girl that actually mattered in Bond's life. The other girls were more badass than sexy.

Then, the third act comes, and everything falls apart. I was excited when they get to the base. A full-on seige! Everything building to this face-off. But, it all sort of falls apart story-wise, and the chapter's pacing just feels off.

 The villain's motive no longer makes sense (just sort of selling to the highest bidder gag). It would've been better if he wanted to take over the world. Would've fit his sense of maniacal justice.

When everyone's split up, the characters wander in circles for a bit as time runs out. The villain disappears. Another issue arises: M has to confess to the US Navy to authorize a missile strike. The sub-plot regarding M's intelligence mistake would've come to a head with communication over destroying the base. They cut as he has to make that decision. When we get back, the missiles are being fired. That sub-plot finishes with no dramatic consequence. The villain pops back up out of nowhere, and Bond gets contaminated. Missiles blow everything up. The end. All the soppy sacrifice shit just felt like a dud.

All-in-all it's better than Quantum and Spectre, but it's so weak compared to Casino Royale and Skyfall. Would've preferred Bond not to die as well. It would've provided a bittersweet ending to Craig's Bond. He's always quitting, and returning, in his films. It would've been the perfect stab in the heart for his 007 job to be an ever-ending curse.

It's ugly. 

Most sci-fi / fantasy worlds aspire to be beautiful. Even post apocalyptic or dystopian stuff like Mad Max or Blade Runner, aspire to a pleasing aesthetic.  Dune... does not. And, to me, that's what makes it so wonderful! It's a genuinely scary place to be, it FEELS inhospitable, and it FEELS super alien. Existenze is the only other film I can think of, that isn't a horror, that does a similar thing. I mean, I'm sure there are loads, I but I just mean it's not very common.

It also bothers with worldbuilding. All the Harkonnen stuff like the ratcat-milk, the heart plugs, the fuckin' animal cocktail drink... There's just a ton of extra little things that make you think ""wow, what IS this fucked up place?"" 

The real 'problem' as people have pointed out, is that you can't really film Dune. Denis has done a sterling job so far, but, as Damon Lindelof shows us again and again and again and again, setting up compelling premises is fucking simple, but sticking the landing is the part that matters. The book only manages it because outwardly one thing happens, but inwardly a different one does, and the dramatic irony is good, but without a voice over it's preeetty difficult for that to work.

This movie really wasn't on my radar when it was released last year, but I did see some people on this sub list it on their list of top 10 movies of 2021, so I gave it a shot and I am so glad I did.

With so many big action, and superhero movies out there it was so nice to sit and watch such a human tale. The movie is told from a unique perspective as well, that we don't see portrayed enough in films. The film has a clear message, that I've seen some critics say is too contrived, personally I thought it was a very touching story that did a great job of exploring the experience of an immigrant. From the inhumanity of the immigration system, to the disconnect from the culture of their ancestors. Antonio LeBlanc's struggle to understand where he fit in the world, and to try and be there for his children was very moving, and I thought his step daughter's performance (Jessie LeBlanc) was excellent. Often you see children in movies seem overly mature, or they are just one dimensional characters. I thought her performance had a lot of depth, she was honest and unafraid to share her thoughts and feelings, the way she handled the situation her family was going through felt very realistic.

I really think more people should watch this movie, if nothing else but to better understand what immigrants go through and how completely ridiculous some immigration policies are. Make sure to bring the tissues though.",6/2/2022 17:37,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5076628352490422,1,0.26580459770114945,1.0

One fateful night, a conman (Frank Grillo) on the run from something finds himself booked in a police station in a small Nevada town. A drunk stranger (Gerard Butler) also finds himself in the same jail as the conman, and it soon becomes apparent he has a score to settle with the conman Teddy. Frank Grill and Gerard Butler are in top form as they verbally spar and try to gain the upper hand on each other, but it's really Alexis Louder's and Toby Huss's show. Newcomer Alexis Louder plays the hotshot cop entangled in this shitstorm, and she is more than up to the task, showing off her natural charisma and action chops. Toby Huss livens up the film as the cooky and psychopathic hit man who gleefully chews up the scenery. The entire film feels like a throwback to the action films of the 70's, from the 70's style soundtrack to the focus on the buildup to the chaos than on jamming action scenes and explosions just because. Maybe it's good that Joe Carnahan has gotten away from the mainstream Hollywood studios, because then we would get more of these original old-school action flicks like this.",17/4/2022 16:01,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.3420454545454545,0,0.11647727272727272,1.0

The background actors are fewer and they keep weird distance from each other. The scale feels more TV and stage than movie.

As for not wanting to watch the MCU, do check out Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The fighting style is exactly what you're looking for in over the top and flying. 

Honestly, if you want to look for similar fight scenes, just look for some of the best martial artists that are actors and search their fight scenes up on YouTube and find the movies.

I REALLY enjoyed this movie, right up until the part where they arrived at Ta Lo. I cant quite put my finger on it, but the final battles just seemed disjointed? Confused? Like, Shang-Chi is fighting his dad, but then we have to pause for a while to watch Katy be awesome with a bow or whatever. And the Dweller-in-Darkness was kind of a last-minute, heres the REAL bad guy, now care about it type of deal (sort of like Black Widow).

I dont know if this is faithful to the comics or anything, and I guess Id have to give it a rewatch to really critique it, but overall I look forward to seeing more of the characters.

It was terrible in so many ways. The dialogue (your voice! How did you manage to reclaim it!), unintelligible actors (the only way I could tell if some of them were speaking English or Japanese was because the Japanese dialogue was subtitled), characters with no arc or motivations (Psycho? The samurai dude who randomly killed everybody?), scenes that had zero consequences (the bicycle, the girl mowing people down with the gatling gun), no payoff (ratman repairs all the cars to get people out of there, nobody uses the cars), bad props (plastic ridfles, the electronics on Cages suit looked like terrible cosplay props), and zero worldbuilding (what about this radiation? How did the governor get to be in charge of this western town? Why is that clock structure there?).

I get that arthouse doesnt have to be a straightforward narrative and that some things can be left unexplained, but that never seemed to be the result of a conscious choice on the filmmakers part, just sheer incompetence.

It's a hate film about women. Nothing more. It doesn't bother exploring Pippa's confusion, sexuality, desires, or curiosity. It begins with a violation of HER privacy and consent - let's not forget the rigged apartment lease! And lets not forget that the couple stages domestic violence and other things that would draw concern from any reasonable neighbor. It's just ""Pippa is a bad woman who makes bad choices and deserves public humiliation"". The takeaway is...if you're ""nosy"" people can and should see your tits! So which is it, society - are we supposed to notice people or not? There is so much regret and guilt about NOT noticing people (i.e. suicide, DV, mental health, poverty, etc.). So to have the act of noticing so deeply condemned...that's where the film loses me. It doesn't know it's own message. If someone can tell me the bottom line of the film in one sentence...that would be great. I don't think the writer/director gave it that much thought.

I recommend The Protege if you're looking for an ass kicking, female lead action movie. But I also want to make sure it's out there, this is just my opinion. If you love The rhythm section then hey good on you",18/10/2022 19:48,0.0,,,0.5542735042735042,1,,

Its something that is always kind of on the table with horror  the possibility of an eventual passing of the torch by a legendary slasher  and I quite liked the execution of the idea. I think the biggest flaws with the movie arent in its ideas, but the fact that it all felt a little too rushed

If Corey had been introduced in Halloween Kills instead  maybe Michael lets him go mid-killing spree, hinting at what was to come in the next film  then I think more people might be able to see that there was a genuine attempt at something new. I had to suspend my disbelief a tad when it came to how quickly Allyson fell for Corey, but other than that I was just pleased by new ideas in such a well-travelled genre",17/10/2022 03:49,1.0,1.0,,0.6006060606060607,1,0.3329040404040404,2.0

We've all heard of these films and know what they are, but that's because they just came out. They won't stand the test of time, and there'll be no incentive for distributors to keep them available 50 years from now.

Now consider that those three films are probably in the top 200 most high profile films that will be released in 2021. Each year many thousands of films are released globally. 

In my experience only a tiny percentage of films are available to watch, even when piracy is included. Yes there are endless films available to me, and I'll literally never run out of great movies to watch, but I very often have to just accept that a particular movie is just out of reach, and I can't imagine a distributor is gonna rectify that any time soon.",28/8/2021 16:21,0.0,,,0.5015555555555555,1,,

I watched that documentary ""The Most Beautiful Boy in The World"" all about Bjorn. It's quite informative on the whole story. It's a fantastic watch, I would highly recommend everyone to watch it. 

Before Bjorn visited Japan he used to receive thousands of fan mail letters from Japanese fans. Then when he visited there it was like Beatlemania.. everywhere he went there were mass crowds trying to touch him or with scissors trying to clip a lock of his hair, huge signs everywhere saying ""Welcome to Japan, Bjorn!"".

I believe the film's success and influence in Japan is somewhat understated in the West. His popularity, as result of the film, was capitalised in many ways in Japan such as advertising and indeed a successful pop singing career (He sang in Japanese, a language completely unknown to him! I found this very impressive!)

There was an Manga artist, Ryoka Ikeda, I think she authored The Rose of Versailles. She said the character, a beautiful female dressing and acting as a man, was directly influenced by Bjorn Andresen. She also spoke of how there was a change in manga circles around that time due to the film, and how much of an influence Bjorn was on manga and anime of today, specifically the typical white, blonde, effeminate male characters widely seen in some manga genres.",13/9/2021 03:40,1.0,1.0,,0.4560555555555555,0,0.2664444444444445,1.0

If you look at Matt Damon and ignore his cameos in movies and the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot he was in for his friend Kevin Smith he doesnt really have a bad film going back 11+ years; The Adjustment Bureau, Contagion, We Bought a Zoo, Elysium, The Martian, Interstellar, Jason Bourne, Ford V Ferrari, Stillwater, The Last Duel, he really does a good job avoiding being in awful films 

Leo is the same way, if you look at his last movies starring in its nuts; Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Revenant, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Django, J Edgar (mid but not bad), Inception, Shutter Island, like going so long without attaching yourself to a truly bad movie is such a skill a lot of actors and actresses do not have",26/12/2022 02:02,0.0,,,0.4032608695652174,0,,

The Purgefranchise has never been one to waffle around in what some might call ""subtlety"" and this movie might be the most blunt and heavy handed of all of them. The preceding movies put more and more focus on the social themes the series was trying to convey until my pick for best in the franchiseThe First Purgeopenly states that the Purge is used by government officials as a means of class and ethnic control.The Forever Purgeimagines what happens when that kind of idealogue escapes its way into the general population.

Focusing on two Mexican immigrants, the story quickly pushes into their first Purge night as Americans settling an awful lot of time on a convoy of armored trucks driving around and purging all of the ""non Americans"" they come across (hint: non-whites) that certainly isn't ham-fisted foreshadowing. The Purge ends in the morning and they all return back to their lives.

Or do they?

Quickly it is revealed that the Purge is in fact not over, and perhaps it never will be, as the Purgers reveal they don't plan to ever stop purging. One of the purgers who properly kick starts the movie reveals that he's doing it out of some nihilistic leftist view of destroying exploitation and wage slavery, displaying that all of the people senselessly butchering others in the streets aren't all an implausibly large group of white supremacists able to defeat the military rolling in to establish order. The real root cause is the rage that American society breeds and the fetishization of violence that comes with it. One of the subtleties the movie does get across quite well. Most Americans have very vague and nebulous political beliefs. Murder and anger are the true beliefs prevalent in America.

On a technical level, this movie does impress more than a lot ofPurgemovies. There's an impressive long take featuring a tank that is engaging. The characters are a little more fleshed out than otherPurgemovies including a fairly obvious but still satisfying redemption arc. Sometimes the movie falls back into the series' worst elements (an incredibly cringe inducing monologue by a Nazi with a swastika on his cheek, a cool one-liner near the end that made me groan), but still it never dipped too low where it pulled me out of what was going on.

This movie has a lot to say, even if a lot of it is surface level and obvious, but I will give it props for actually having something meaningful and heavy to say, especially for a Hollywood franchise. Brutally nihilistic, incredibly gory, and very in your face,The Forever Purgecaptures a good amount of what a lot of people feel about the future of America, while also being a decent action/horror movie to boot.",2/7/2021 5:04,1.0,1.0,,0.46578947368421053,0,0.11899540517961571,1.0

The other is the Deep House. That concept was fucking amazing. A haunted house underwater.

As a nobody trying to be an actor, I have noticed that the overwhelming majority of things I see casting calls for now skew LGBTQ or ethnically based. Which is great but another caveat is now the majority of calls are looking for people who are legitimately what the brief is looking for... Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of acting.. So ya, from what I see both on screen and in the call sheets it is def trending towards LGBTQ. Which to pick up on the point above I don't feal there doing a good job off even.

The best news is people are becoming more comfortable going back to the movies eventhough the audiences have become more selective with what they want to see in theaters. 

The most concerning news is F9 had a 70% drop in its second week, which is becoming a very common result this year with theatrical movies. Also Boss Baby 2 did the best it could with the massive obstacles it's up against and a major warning for kids/family films since children are still unvaccinated and the looming danger of the Delta Variant. 

An additional side note that most likely factored in less tickets sales is streaming had a massive Fourth of July weekend. Offering a lot of movies on various demographics with Tomorrow War grabbing the action oriented audiences, Fear Street 1994 for the horror audience, No Sudden Move for the crime thriller audience, and Boss Baby 2 had a day and date release for the kids/family audience.

Both Sky and Netflix have more volume and Sky definitely has a better offering thanks to their deals with all the major studios outside of Disney and half the lesser studios but Amazon have definitely been improving their new movie offerings in the last year or two and will hopefully continue to do so further in the future. The purchase of MGM should help them in this regard in the long term. They have always been a pretty solid home of older movies in the U.K.",14/7/2021 20:33,0.0,,,0.470995670995671,0,,

I will even go as far as to say that was better than the first one and I love the original. The romance between K and Joi was miles better than Deckard and Rachel's; that sex scene/ foreplay was the most captivating (and sexy) thing I've seen in a movie this year. The character development in general was handled better than the first one. Ana for instance is only in one scene and you learn so much about her through dialogue and visuals (knowing about her past, the birthday cake is depressing). And the score, while playing off of the first one, expanded on the original and created this unsettling but also hypnotic tone. 
 
Edit: Listening to the soundtrack, the track ""Wallace"" is the perfect example of unsettling and beautiful. It also goes well with the titular character's elusiveness and he's egotistical/ self-importance; he believes himself to be God (which he kind of is) and the track reflects this with the Tuvan throat singing (or what appears to sound like it) which give this image of worship and deity. It's cool as fuck.

The track ""Sea Wall"" is also bad-ass.  ",8/10/2017 15:24,1.0,1.0,,0.6270312499999999,1,0.20265624999999993,1.0

This film has it's plot (a woman and her friends get trapped underground with a race of cannibal monsters) and it's subtext (a woman is traumatised by a tragedy and has to rediscover her self.) 

The subtext is driven home by some incredible imagery. Namely, the shot of her daughter holding a birthday cake which appears at key moments throughout. After they become trapped with the monsters, the shot appears again but with the monsters screaming face over her daughter's face.

The symbolism is clear. Her trauma over the loss of her daughter is now being projected externally on the very real monsters and immediate terror. By dealing with the monsters she is dealing with her trauma.

This all comes to a head when she goes to the lowest depths and discovers the dark secret at the heart of the trauma. That her best friend was having an affair with her husband. She then becomes a monster herself.

At the end, she takes revenge on her real enemy (Juno) by leaving her to die. She dreams of escape because this is the subtext. She has found release from her trauma. When we cut back to the cave, this is made explicit by showing her with her daughter and the birthday cake, finally reunited in her mind.

It is the epitome of a bittersweet ending. Lost in reality, but at peace and finally made whole on the inside.",11/6/2016 20:39,1.0,1.0,,0.4827450980392157,0,0.1398039215686275,1.0

In the first dialog while interrogating we learn the Dror was ""seen by a girl"" which is why they suspect him.  This is never mentioned again.  When released from van, he hangs bike on the wall (which is really the door to the secret room which we as the viewer are unaware of.)  They find the headless body, dad shows up blah blah your standard fare movie stuff.  Fast forward, the cop is taking Dror again, cop gets call to make sure he gets daughter.  This is a pivotal scene.  We see Dror take a plastic bag (which i believe has the head in it), throw it away across the street, then help and old lady back.  We are distracted from this because the cop makes a comment about who helps old ladies still.  But before we can process what we saw, now we are introduced to the father of the murdered girl trailing both the cop and Dror.  We see dad's motives blah blah day forward to Dror missing his girls, wanting to give ""birthday present"". This distracts us completely to the fact that the girl he makes the cake for, is not his daughter, it's the cops daughter.  And it's not a birthday cake, it's a rape cake.  Up to and including all the torture, not once does Dror falter, not the viewer suspect him guilty.  I thought it was the father all along, and he was just twisted.  But once he left to dig up head,i knew it couldn't be him.  Then we find cops daughter is missing, can't be Dror, he's been in basement.  You never think back to the birthday cake scene, because it was set up to appear like it was his daughter, with bike in background and everything.  It's not until the final frame we see the secret room and the cops daughter unconscious in said room.  During the birthday cake sequence, all the men can be seen plotting their misdeeds, but because we've seen nothing ""bad"" from Dror, we just assume it's for good.  Dad tightening chair, cop packing taser, and pedophile drugging his victim.  I thought this was a fantastic movie.  I agree in spots the acting was a bit meh, but overall i thought it was well acted, and definitely kept me guessing till the end as far as what really took place.

The ENTIRE thing with Nomi's brain surgery is a thinly veiled criticism against cis people, and the reason I didn't like it is because it makes it seem like all cis people HATE trans people. I get the mother daughter thing, and some people can be really psycho and want to pray away the gay or even worse so MAYBE the mom wanted to lobotomize Nomi, but an entire hospital is there to back her up, she can't contact the outside world, she is trapped, etc. I get where the writers are coming from, especially with what the Wachowskis went through (and what you see Ms. Jenner go through), but I thought it was too venomous. Again, it could be totally called for, but it seems to generalize and I didn't like that...

The sensate who gave birth to the sensates was being hunted down by a white male who seemed to relish in hunting down women (he really does, in fact he only hunts down the women, the men come to him). Really, how easy is it to have an antagonist who is pure evil, who wants to break all the good guys down and bring them under his heel or to just kill them, for no reason at all?

I wish I could remember more about this but it was just part of my criticism of the show. My main issue is that at the end of season 1, after 10 hours of television, not much happened, so they'll either have to rush season 2 to get to a point where all the sensates are interacting with each other and are ready to face things together as a group (not just pairs).

It was freaking hilarious, we laughed the whole time. Very early on it became obvious that the main purpose of the movie was to spoof the living hell out of action movie tropes, and boy, did it ever! It took nothing seriously, nothing at face value, it fucked with action movie themes and ideas just as hard as it possibly could, and it was SO much fun to watch because of that. 

Most action movies are witless piles of garbage full of carnage and stupidity, but Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard was, while full of carnage, full of wit as well, and that made all the difference.

A shame it didn't do so well at the box office -- anyone who uncritically likes action movies probably wouldn't like it, because it fucks with the tropes so hard.

We saw kickass get incredibly abused, hitgirl's entire childhood was being a tool to enact a parental vendetta, and in attempting said vendetta big daddy was burned to death in front of his daughter's eyes. There were flawed characters that each had arcs and endings.

Kickass is a complete story (if you discount the very end scene which I can only imagine they left in there because $$$?).

KA2 was an abomination. What growing up was there in the film? It didn't exploit the consequences of deranged superhero fantasies, it reveled in it. Just look at the poop gun scene and how fucking gratuitous it is. They revel in the fact that hitgirl is so cool with her superhero gadgets! Wouldn't you want a gun that could do that to those stupid queen bees in highschool?

Speaking of which the cliche queen bee character was so fucking flat I could actually see the curvature of the earth. ""Queen Bee"" is an archtype specifically designed to manipulate the audience to hate the character. It is simply shitty writing. 

At the end of KA2 we see hitgirl go off as a loner batman type and kickass form the superhero awesome league or whatever. KA2 did the exact opposite of what you claimed it did. KA2 ended on a ""Fuck yeah thats awesome!"" and not a ""Grow the fuck up"". In fact, kickass 1 ended with the characters putting that life behind them and realizing that normality isn't necessarily better than the alternative.

He quite literally stalks his ex girlfriend that he hasnt seen in years. Follows her home from work one night and walks directly into her home behind her. Then he spends the rest of the movie lying to and manipulating her until she gives in and takes him back. 

There is also that off-putting aspect of rip the evil bitchs clothes off that was this weird unifier of the team. Why is this woman so vile and evil you may ask? She is an owner and wants to sell the team. The team that sucks and makes no money. They present her as a cruella deville type of character and its wild.

The others have tried to stay too true to the original and not update or do a new angle. Cinderella compared to maleficent is a great example of this. While Cinderella was very close to the original and was frankly meh, Maleficent was an interesting twist while still containing was what great about the characters. Cruella did the same but much like 101 Dalmatians is often overlooked. 

Once upon a time was a great series that gained a lot of audiences at the start by doing the same. They then did the whole season 4 frozen thing that was not the normal twist and saw audiences complain because it was too close. They wanted to see an evil elsa or at least a twist in some way. 

If you look too at what are being remade, it is those titles that can't been shown to kids due to the originals not aging well. This is so kids get to know their older characters. Aladdin, jungle book, mulan, and Dumbo all have warnings now due to a shift in what is seen as acceptable or straight up don't appear in the kids sections. 

Peter pan has a real issue type of remake with this and it is just not possible to do in such a way that they used a Tinkerbell and Jake and the Neverland pirates series instead. That's what they need to do in other ways but nostalgia in parents too comes into the equation. 101 Dalmatian street and the new takes on Mickey and co is proving popular but it not as far reaching due to the paywall that is having disney plus or cable/sky/virgin so don't make any where as much money. 

So not all are flops but they also aren't made for you or for the reason you might realise. It might just be about protecting their old characters or trying to reignite interest for merchandise.",1/1/2023 13:27,0.0,,,0.4953654188948307,0,,

A lot of the female villains in the original films were in my opinion a little shallow; they seemed to be evil for the sake of being evil and their motives seem more like excuses rather than actual reasons for their villiainry. For example: Maleficent. Cursing a baby just because her parents did not invite her to the christening? Very unfair and makes little sense (for our human brain at least). Cursing a baby because her father is a genocidal arsehole who has betrayed her and tailoring the curse as an echo to the the betrayal? Makes a lot more sense. Similarly, with Cruella, we get an actual explanation as to why she is not a 'nice' person. 

By this hypothesis, a good film to remake then would be The Little Mermaid but from Ursula's perspective. The reason why she was banished from the palace was never revealed in the films proper and it would be nice to see the events leading up to that. According to the stage musical, Ursula was supposed to rule the seas with King Triton but he eventually banished her because she used dark magic and was greedy. Well...what if that was wrong? What if the reason why Ursula was so keen to take back the throne was because she was the rightful ruler (or at least co ruler) of the sea and Triton kicked her out so he can have the kingdom for himself? There could be a subplot in which Ariel finds out that Ursula was the true Queen of the Sea and both help each other get what they want. 

Oh and I hope they don't remake The Hunchback of Notre Dame. That film is way too good. There is nothing to improve on.",1/1/2023 10:21,1.0,1.0,,0.4997549019607843,0,0.0033979500891265484,1.0

The animated movies is just Mowgli wandering around the jungle. I would also argue that Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, and Pete and the Magic Dragon were also transformative enough to be decent movies, if not great. Lady and the Tramp is also mildly remarkable for its canine stars being shelter dogs trained for most of the stunts with cgi to make their faces more expressive, Same goes for Cruella and Maleficent, both of which were kinda silly but they were new perspectives on old stories.

Starting around Beauty and the Beast reboot, they basically did color-by-number recreations, but usually with un-added flourishes added, most of those flourishes being crowdsourced from decades of internet nit-picks and theories. So it feels unoriginal, and made to address nit-picks, theories, and quibbles that middle the focus. Add fluff piece articles to make much ado of minimal strides towards representation (We made LaFou gay!!!) as cheap publicity, making Disney look desperate for even a scrap of good press. Mulan, while largely transformative, was made absolutely wrongheadedly, and was one of the three strikes that made China stop taking Disneys movies (which might actually be best in the long run).

Some of these movies might have been salvageable if they had simply not tried to recapture the magic of the animated movies. Aladdin as essentially Hitch 2 but with magic would been easy money. Lion King as Shakespeare told through a nature documentary, complete with a narrator as Greek Chorus, would be interesting, and justify them adhering to photorealistic portrayals of the characters. If they had simply let Donnie Yen direct Mulan I guarantee it would at least be as fun to watch as a middling action movie with more than a few good action scenes. While watching Beauty and the Beast felt like someone slowly grind my brain against a brick wall in an attempt to paint it, giving Beast a whole song (Evermore) to sing was absolutely the right thing to do.",1/1/2023 7:01,0.0,,,0.467969612087259,0,,

It reminds me a lot a 80s/90s movies which I really like. With stupid fast action, funny dialogues, nice cast (better cast has only Expendables, Star Trek and Ocean's) and popcorn plot with a great music and nice director's work. I really liked the first movie, third movie and for me the revolution begin with fifth, sixth, seventh movie, where I became a fan. I simply loved director's effort of Justin Lin, James Wan and F. Gary Gray. Those were NAMES. I also like side-characters and their actors like - Kurt Russel, Scott Eastwood, Jason Statham, The Rock (possibly his best role), Luke Evans or Tony Jaa. But something tells me, that they should've stop after the eight one. That was the biggest peak. 

I also really enjoy Hobbs and Shaw, which reminds me a lot a movies like Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour. It was a really good movie, with also fantastic cast. Vanessa Kirby, Hellen Mirren, Idris Elba, Eiza Gonzales (and her scenes!!). Like a proper action flick. 

But from the moment F9 was announce I just felt that this isn't right. Justin Lin didn't succeed with Star Trek: Beyond (he killed that franchise) and coming back with a sterile film. This series did many thing wrong and crazy, impossible at least. But - they didn't ,,reviving characters just like that"". What they did with Han completely destroys this franchise for good. Leaving all the side characters outside was another ,,misstep"". And Vin Diesel as the only hero of this franchise is just ,,wrong"". The only replacement for Paul Walker should be Scott Eastwood or at least Statham maybe even The Rock. Not the melodrama between Vin and Michelle. And now, even Justin is gone and some no-name director directs the finale of the franchise. So sad. I really like the franchise to the eight entry. Now I cannot see it. Vin became worse than The Rock.

So the Japanese casino owner wants to make billions by getting the head of a special zombie and selling it to the US military. Why the shit didn't he just tell Dave Bautista and his crew to grab a special zombie head, then? Why go to the trouble of tricking them with a casino heist?

The casino owner didn't even need to hire mercenaries. He was shown hosting generals / Department of Defense officials at his home. None of those high-ranking officials could put together a team to grab a zombie head?

For that matter, why the shit did the military need the Japanese dude at all? The military controlled the no fly zone over Las Vegas, so they could've just sent in a chopper with a single team of elite soldiers to go in, grab a special zombie head, and then get choppered back out.

But I never have enjoyed any of his shows. They are all way too overly melodramatic. Those Who Wish Me Dead was also a terrible adaptation to a pretty good book too. He's one of the few Hollywood writers that truly understands rural America, which is why he is so successful. It just seems like he's writing for such a casual audience that watches network tv. It infuriates me 

I don't blame him for the amount of money he's making and for all the people that enjoy his shows. But, it's very possible his best writing is behind him . He wrote that Neo-western trilogy before Sicario was released in 2015. At that time, he was living check to check in an apartment with a baby on the way.

For my part, I didn't like how Chastain's character was able to express discomfort and disgust with the torture programs, but the eagerly take the intelligence gained and go act on it.  Her buddy was presented as doing a terrible thing out of practical necessity, for the greater good.

It was hugely arrogant of the film to try to convince us that torture was both abhorrent and sometimes genuinely necessary.  It utterly glossed over the hypocritical reservations that many Americans had.  

As a matter of historical accuracy, the CIA consistently claimed their torture programs produced actionable intelligence in the hunt for Bin Laden.  A Senate investigation challenges that story, but that was the narrative.  The movie simply asks us to accept that it happened the way the CIA said, that the taliban were bad guys, and not to worry too much about the ethical implications.

I realize they won't be dead on with the book, but if they stray too far from the source material, I find that to be disrespectful I guess.

Doctor Sleep was unique because the changes they made were subtle, as a goal to ultimately connect it with the 1980 film, while at the same time, attempting to stay true to the book, but reaching to certain details in a different way.

The recent adaptations to Stephen King's IT were drastically different than the book, but it still worked simply because it ""felt"" like Stephen King.

Later this year, an adaptation of Tom Clancy's Without Remorse is suppose to come out, but I'm cringing already at what I've read about it... Without Remorse was the most bad ass book I ever read.

A lot of people talked about the commentary on humane treatment of animals, but I didn't see much discussion of humane treatment of minorities in media. I went in to this movie expecting race commentary given Peele's track record but it could also be a suboptimal lens. ""Minorities in media"" was brought up so many times. Oprah. Angel's gf Diaz leaves him for a show on the CW. The MC is descended from the first minority (and first person ever?) recorded on film. Yeun is a child actor and becomes a performer. I feel like Yeun is a good example for a race reading of the film. Of the family, he's the only one to survive (physically) unscathed. The monkey seems to connect with him. Perhaps it recognizes they are similarly mistreated by the media. That said, others make compelling arguments that this was because he was the only one inadvertently respecting it. Yeun will never grow from that experience, further opting in to the ""performer"" side of his life. He leans in to the stage name Jupiter, showing his flaw of his misunderstanding animals by equating himself to the alien, itself a being a the sky and storms. The cowboy image he uses is quintessentially American. It's connotations with American film are inseparable. 

The strongest case for the race reading is Daniel Kaluuya at the start, when he's handling Lucky for the ad crew. Others mentioned he looks really nervous/ shy. I think that's because he's supposed to ""be"" the animal, in some sense. He's very nervous in front of the crew, unlike his sister who's a natural at performing. He doesn't make eye contact with the crew who basically stares him down, showing that they're unable to engage with the rules of the observed. It looks as if the cinematographer is filming him. Speaking of him, he is ride or die for entertainment. The protagonist qualities the movie values are empathy for the performer. Kaluuya is the only person with empathy for the horses, and the alien. The woman is interesting: she is extremely white, (blue eyes, huge blond hair) and old, in a caricature that feels like shorthand for ""white bitch."" This is backed up by the director(?) engaging her in conversation super positively, and treating Kaluuya like shit. Another detail: OJ is named after OJ Simpson, a huge development in media treating horrific stories of violence as entertainment. Everyone in the film is complicit in this. Yeun trains the alien who inadvertently kills MC's dad (with emphasis on the coin dealing the lethal blow, and the ""in god we trust"" message on it, as if to say God has no jurisdiction here. It almost feels like the real start of the movie is the patriarch, the protector of the land, dying.), and the crowd. OJ wants to catch the alien and make money, barely acknowledging when Angel mentions they could save the world. Emerald plugs her business at the start. 

The meaning, as far as I can tell, is that we should be more thoughtful when consuming violence media. The alien can't harm one who doesn't observe it, and physically resembles an old camera. Also, the observation that it tries to resemble what we want is so fascinating. And then there's the fact that it's a uterus... basically no idea what to make of it. Maybe women are harmed by the normalization of violence media? Or that they're culprits in it, since every single woman on planet earth loves true crime documentaries. The race reading of the meaning of the film still holds up. Yeun, not learning from the past, goes back in to performance and gets fucked up. Emerald is fine performing but the ending emphasizes her ordeal more than it does for OJ, who does not perform at all. 

Man this movie was good. Loved reading the discussion and thinking about it during the film. 8/10!",5/9/2022 0:57,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.4827760362243121,0,0.10014865402796438,1.0

She's asked to do comedy, drama, absurdism, kung fu, prop work and prop comedy, multilingual acting and shifting within scene between it, and character acting as WELL as a grounded performance in the SAME movie...if she doesn't win every top award for this, Hollywood is fuckin insane.

The movie was ride or die on the power of her performance and the performance and grounding of the actors and they all fuckin DEMOLISHED my expectations. It was such a fuckin amazing movie.

The last episode is when him and Stevie get offered jobs by one of Abe's friends. She does turn it down because she wants Malcolm to go to college. The entire point of that is he's going to work harder than anyone else and still not be good enough in the eyes of others because of where he came from. But that will make him a good president because he knows what it's like to not come from the elite. 

When Malcolm gets angry at her for it, ghe whole family (whilst covered in that gunk from Reece's septic tank prank) all agree with Lois. And Lois challenges Malcolm to tell her he couldn't be president. He can't because he knows she right. Hal even makes a joke about Malcolm not getting the easy ride through life but Dewey will.

The bittersweet ending to Malcolm in the Middle follows the trend of all episodes ending in a slight negative in terms of outcome for Malcolm. It's also more believable than a magic mcguffin job offer at the end of the series. With the final shot being him putting away a mop bucket and running off to his college classes with the same song from the first episode playing in the background.

You could argue what Lois did was spiteful but no one else challenged her in that moment. Not even Francis who would have called Lois out on it. So if anything the entire family is spiteful to Malcolm in that moment.",1/2/2023 8:51,0.0,,,0.4463595583160801,0,,

Mr. Freeze doesn't have to have a Freeze-Ray and cackle maniacally like Arnold did. He's also rarely a pure villain. Clayface would be super interesting, because you CAN keep that grounded, if you just focus on his face, maybe his skin in total just running down his body, instead of turning him into actual clay. It all depends on the angle and the CGI. Penguin wasn't ""a penguin"", just a guy with scars and a limp. I'm just sad, they didn't give him an umbrella. We've already seen Two-Face, Joker and Scarecrow done more realistically. The Mad Hatter would be super easy to do, it's ""just"" mental illness. They even turned Riddler into something believable (and not Jim Carrey, although I adore those movies still), almost too grounded. Poison Ivy would also be super easy if you leave out most of the more fantastical stuff. Just make her a doctor trying to stop climate change, I mean that's kinda how most modern movies roll anyway now ... she gets so frustrated that she resorts to eco terrorism and starts experimenting on herself, splices her body with plant DNA or whatever and gets some mild powers, but mainly uses concoctions to poison people and fast growing weeds to destabilize buildings or whatever.

There were some serious pacing issues, did we really need to spend an entire minute seeing Batman grab a letter out of a bat cage? I felt this movie's runtime, and by the end I was frequently checking my phone to see when this movie would end. There's a large chunk of this film that could be cut out and nothing would be lost imo. The characters themselves were also not that interesting, I was not a fan of emo Bruce Wayne, and Catwoman didn't have enough of a personality for me to care about her missing girlfriend, or her daddy issues. This film was so heavy with it's exposition in the mystery story, that it forgot to breath and have character moments. I seriously wonder what the ratio of Batman to Bruce Wayne screentime in this movie is. I think it would easily be the highest of any batman film, cause this movie barely had Bruce himself in it.

Riddler was.. good, but not great , I will admit I liked the idea of Riddler being a fan of the Batman, but the interrogation scene really turned me off on him. His screeching and moaning was more cringe-worthy rather than frightening to me. Also the Joker tease at the end... Batman has probably the largest rogue's gallery of excellent villains to pull from. Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, Hugo Strange, the Mad-Hatter, Poison Ivy, etc. I know Joker is his most iconic enemy, but this is legit going to be our 4th joker in the last 14 years.

Like a movie I watched which was pretty decent was Next Gen on netflix, sort of a Chinese/american take on Big Hero 6, but its actually much darker a film than one you expect for kids and I don't think did well despite being pretty good. I remember watching the intro to Nezha and thinking...chinese guys, the long-earlobed fat guy stereotype is not something we know how to deal with in the west.

Or for live action, i like to point out that in the west in the 80s, Back to the Future was pretty big. In the 80s in China, Mister Vampire, a comedy about hopping jiang-shi zombies that cant see you if you hold your breath spawned an entire genre.

I haven't seen wish dragon, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case. It's like the Green Snake films that they keep redoing; that form of taoist animism is just a bit too weird for western audiences to really get into.

Its one thing to say something like it was so bad I had to take a break in the middle but to say that you literally never finished it is a whole other thing. Also, idk what your whole 9 year old target demo shtick is about, Wish Dragon touches on way more mature themes than Aladdin does and the characters (specifically the main cast) are more grounded in my opinion. For one, the true antagonist so to speak of this film which impedes Din the whole way is the socioeconomic divide he tries to overcome while actively avoiding wishing for money whereas in Aladdin the peasant-princess relationship which should be integral is nothing more than a minor hurdle in the grand scheme of things while an actual conniving villain influences things behind the scenes. Not that theres anything wrong with that implicitly, its just that villains like Jafar are far more geared towards younger audiences since its easier to understand. 

Dins relationship with Li Na is almost never portrayed as anything more than platonic. I think youre just suffering from what Id call male+female leads syndrome where you automatically assume the leads end up together. 

Most of your plot holes arent actually plot holes. It didnt have to be on the day of the party, but why shouldnt it be. In Dins mind that probably makes it nicer to socialize. I dont think its a problem that Li Nas dad knew about the teapot, its probably a legend thats been passed down. Also, the convenient timing could be explained by the intentions of God who specifically gave Din the teapot (a distinct difference from Aladdin whose chosen nature is a lot more vague and sort of indirect). Also, Don didnt wish to be a prince for a day, he wished to have all the benefits of being rich for a day. Theres a similarity there, sure, but the fact you equates them directly by misplacing Dins wish kind of shows that your comparisons are more based on confirmation bias, probably from after seeing the trailer, than actual observation. Dins character being an optimist and not expecting the worst isnt a plot hole, its a personality trait. Hes portrayed as smart, but his actions are clearly informed more by his intuition and emotions. Hes always got an idealistic outlook on the world and thats not a contradiction. Now if that idealist world were constantly reaffirmed Id actually call that a pretty good critique, but its not. His world views are challenged and he eventually hits a low point that he needs to recover from. The thing with the fight scene looking like he doesnt have control is actually a pretty valid criticism imo, though I think they do a better job at making his fights more intentional later on. Although even if he ends up not literally knowing how to fight, its not like thats any better than Aladdin wishing to be a prince and essentially being given a prince costume and a parade. Aladdin never actually becomes a prince until he marries Jasmine which was out of the Genies control meaning that the Genie failed to fulfill the wish.

Personally I never had any issues with the animation design or the lip-syncing so Id just say that the animation is more of a preference thing and that its possible I missed a bad sync. 

I think that the many surface level similarities are simply meant to be little referenced. This movie isnt a ripoff but it is definitely a love letter to the original and it wears that on its sleeve.

You see what hes passionate about, and you see what kind of guy he is: hes serious about his work but hes able to have a laugh. He doesnt particularly like kids (wanting and having kids, and the responsibility of caring for them, is a huge underlying theme in the first Jurassic Park movies). He literally insists a couple times that kids smell. Babies smell!! We then later in the movie see his character suddenly forced to hang out with and take care of two kids in life-or-death situations. Its funny and interesting because we know how difficult it is for himbut hes also good at it. We see him changing and growing. Were invested in this change that hes undergoing.

If you dont click into that, then itd be really hard to care about the action surrounding that emotional core. 

But I will say that one of the things I appreciate about the original Jurassic Park is that these emotional character elements are not dumped on you in a single expository conversation. You see it in bits and pieces of naturally occurring conversation between the characters. If you arent focused on the movie and the dialog, if you dont remember the previous mentions of kids or character details, then the emotional arc wont be very apparent to you. 

Watching movies without a phone anywhere near you can be extremely beneficial to keeping your focus and not missing out on these important details that build the emotional core of a film/movie.",26/12/2022 15:06,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5608371735791091,1,0.06803859447004608,1.0

It was Josh Brolins character yelling at Blunts character about how this is what happens when 20 million people in the states won't stop snorting or injecting cocaine and that is the reason for all of this horror. BULLSHIT.  The reason is because TPTB have instituted a prohibition on stuff that people want, thereby creating a black market for these goods at prices that allows the rise of criminal gangs who create the violence and corruption  that we see today.  Legalize it all and all of the negatives go away.  At worst you deal with treatment for addicts.

Shadow in the cloud - One of my favorite screenplays. A thrill ride from page 1 to the end. But when I watched the film, the soundtrack was very out of place. A lot of the action came off as comedic. The Gremlin on screen was more reminiscent of a syfy channel film than than what terrified me on the page. The scene where the main character climbs under the plane to save her baby was so cheesy.

Had I seen the rating first I may have not even bothered to watch it because films below 5 usually start to become very iffy in their production quality, but in this that was topnotch.

From 1994 to 2000 he either starred or had a supporting role in: Little Giants, Casper, Now and Then, Wild America, SLC Punk!, Idle Hands, Final Destination and playing the titular character in Eminem's ""Stan"" music video.

Now YMMV on the quality of a lot of the things there but there's no denying that Sawa was one of the hottest young actors in Hollywood at the time.

After 2000? He pretty much disappears into direct-to-video movies and one-off TV appearances before he popped back up as a recurring cast member on Nikita.

Now I oretty much grew up on Sawa movies (Idle Hands and Final Destination being two of my teenage favorites back in the day) so I really thought he'd be a star for years to come. I remember him being considered for Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones and always felt he would have been a much better choice than Hayden Christiansen.

Cassie seeks to take revenge against all the abusive, harassing men that enabled or symbolise those who enabled the rape and death of her friend Nina. Half way through the movie, Ninas mother begs her to stop it and move on, for all their sakes, that what shes doing isnt good for Nina and isnt good for herself. But Cassie refuses.

Sure enough, Cassie ends up dead after an ambitious revenge scheme goes wrong and the same guys who abused Nina, end up burning her body. Its shocking and tragic, but consistent with the theme of revenge, tragedy and men abusing women as a cycle.

THEN theres an awful tacked on ending where a convoluted revenge plot kicks in post Cassies death involving text messages, police at a wedding and fucking Angel in the Morning, just for the sake of sending the audience out on a fist pumping high.

Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
Scribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.
Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
For nothing now can ever come to any good.

One of the more subtle ways Tarantino references this is with the whitewashing of Westerns. QT had black cowboys in Django, and Hateful Eight, and in reality, many cowboys were black, Mexicans of mixed heritage, or Native Americans, but in our depiction of the Wild West we see white, English speaking Anglos. In fact, of the 42 original founders of the Pueblo of Los Angeles, only two were white! All of the Mexican characters in this movie are in subservient roles - the valets, the doorman, etc. So what gives? I think QT is making an artistic point - that by whitewashing the history of the West we are perpetuating racism, and the depiction is overshadowing the actual event. The more obvious version of this theme is that the Mansons and other terrorists control society by virtue of their targets, which they choose to instill fear in the populace. The depiction of the crimes are more important than the actual crime. Can we honestly say the Mansons would have just as big a part in our culture if they had murdered random people instead of filmmakers? 

Cliff and his wife is another version of this theme - did he kill his wife? We see in the final scenes that he had the physical capability, but the film ultimately leaves it ambiguous as to whether he did or not. But guess what - it doesn't fucking matter whether he actually did it or not because the depiction, the belief, that he did has overshadowed his life and affected his ability to get jobs.",15/4/2021 06:00,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.48014592933947775,0,0.09086021505376343,1.0

My interpretation of Taxi Driver is that Travis is very easy to sympathise with, a lot of people see the ugly side of themselves in Travis. Its only in the later scenes that we see him become more detached and unhinged. As he descends into insanity, the viewer is asking themselves Is this the same man I sympathised with earlier? What does that say about me?

The doorman even directly quotes Kafka which is a great joke that works on many levels.

The basic idea is that Paul is both a victim of society (because the rules of social interaction are often arbitrary and people are weird) and a victim of his own tendency to overthink human relationships combined with a lack of empathy.

Some observations:

The key symbolizes a way into a community; Paul's irrational fear for the key symbolizes his fear of social interaction. (Also, the exact same thing happened to me once, I bet the scene was based on somebody's personal experience.)

The doorman quoting Kafka is part of the running joke that everybody in SoHo has artistic airs; Paul not understanding that the doorman is doing a bit, is symptomatic of his social awkwardness.

Paul becoming a statue is,among other things, a sly reference to Kafka's Die Verwandlung.

even when things didnt work out, howie always saw an angle to play. and in the end i think he had resolved to dying the second he decided not to call up his girlfriend to call off the bet. he planned it to be his final noble act of sacrifice to try and make up for a lifetime of fucking people over. it was probably the first time he has felt loved by anyone in a long time and was okay with dying as long as she had the money. so kind of a redemption i guess.

and the mob guy didnt give a fuck about the money. he plays by different rules and howie crossed the line by gambling money that wasnt his to gamble and the doors. the 2 thugs wont be able to get out with the jewellery anyways without knowing about the broken mechanism. also, the people in the building definitely heard 2 shots... so it is what it is.

She was a slut. That's not a technical term obviously but that is what she was. She couldn't say no. There are reports of Arthur Miller catching her in the elevator with an employee. She never got love and needed it badly and she used sex to attempt to get it. I think the only thing close in contemporary media was Anna Nicole Smith, who unfortunately wasn't nearly as bright as Monroe and had a worse outcome.

Another aspect due to the time period is that that sort of blatant sexiness wasn't common. It had a bit of legitimacy that fell away after the mid-60s with low budget nudie flicks ala Russ Meyer. All the women were basically Monroe clones anyway.

Monroe worked perfectly as a fantasy but in reality I wouldn't touch her. She's crazy as fuck and not in the good, interesting way. She'll fuck the doorman randomly and then attempt suicide.",5/4/2017 14:34,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5972222222222222,1,-0.031597222222222214,0.0

I still don't understand why I didn't feel it at first.

It seems Jim Parsons received overall positive with a little mixed reviews with his interpretation of Michael, I'm happy for him.

If it's a light, popcorn film and I just want to know how entertaining it might be, I check out someone like Jeremy Jahns who is not a critic but just a regular person with a big audience. If it's a prestige film or a heavy-hitting indie darling, I'm more interested in hearing from critics who have a wealth and breadth of knowledge and experience like the critics from Breakfast All Day or Mark Kermode or the people who run Indiewire's Film Talk podcast or in the past, the Av Club's film reviews because they are looking to dig deep and analyze a film and they can recognize homages or references that I, as a more recent film fan, just can't. 

It also depends on if a film speaks to a particular experience. I recently watched The Boys in the Band and I really enjoyed it but I'm not a gay man or even in the LGBTQ+ community. I also had no idea about the storied history of the play or the previous film or any of that so I checked out the Pop Culture Happy Hour episode about it (which had four critics who all happen to be gay men) as well as listening to the Breakfast All Day episode since one of those critics is an older gay man who had significant knowledge about the original film and the play, etc. It's not that other critics can't or shouldn't have opinions about these films but I'm always curious to see if films like this resonate with the groups of people they are attempting to portray. Do they feel authentic or stereotypical, real or dated and hackneyed? 

While it's true that critics can generally give you an idea if something is worth seeing, I feel that their real aim is approaching a film from the lens of film canon. Where does it fit in, what is it trying to do, what are the themes and messages inherent in it. Film critics are to film what literature teachers are to literature, imo.",12/10/2020 12:03,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.4620663650075415,0,0.18284313725490198,1.0

What happens if I dont become a famous writer or dont publish more books, or dont affect more ripples in the world than I have until now? Will life still be worth living? Is doing a little job and forging a little family and living out this little life, with short vacations in the city, and big and small heartbreaks and joys, worth it? The movie answered the question for me. 

There is a line from a regional Indian movie that stuck with me and got pulled back up into my mind after I watched it. The movie is of a man who is known for perennially fixing things for others, an under-rated scatterbrained commoner who everybody loves for being there for them in his little town, often at the expense of his own challenges. In the movie, a woman asks the protagonist why he's okay running around for other people often, even if it means he might not be as successful as he could be if he was singularly focused on making just his dreams come true. And he says, with a wry smile, how in the game of Lemon and Spoon, the aim is not to reach the finish line as soon as possible. The aim is to make sure that your lemon is well within your spoon till the end. In life, your big and small dreams may not come true, what you foresaw life to mean and be, the big picture, might not always materialize, but at the end of the day, if your lemon is within your spoon - if the people you love and cherish are by your side, no matter your level or definition of accomplishment - then you're lucky. That's his definition of victory. 

I am surrounded by a large loving bunch of family and friends at all times, but I often fight bouts of feeling like I don't bring much to the table, that I don't deserve good company, and that I'm too small to live out this big life. But the fact that Evelyn could have had any of those lives where she was magnificent and successful and talented and where her daughter could have been anything else brought tears to my eyes. Maybe if a day comes, when my mother and father and sister, and the horde of loving friends that has stuck around despite everything else, were given the same choice; do you want a life where I could be something else, something better, would you take her or would you stick with the same daughter/friend/sister, maybe they'd say that they wanted me. This version of me; messy, complicated, and flawed. I hope every single one of you, no matter how little you think of yourself, believe that.",23/1/2023 07:32,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5155515873015872,1,0.19575108225108223,1.0

As for other movies

Set It Up on Netflix-great plot, funny, this is a great rom com


Plus One (maybe still on Hulu)-This is a more straightforward rom com than Set It Up but again very well executed, funny, heartfelt


Palm Springs on Hulu-If you havent seen this movie with Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti please do!  I dont want to spoil it by describing it.  


Long Shot (I think its on HBO Max right now?)-Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron are freaking hilarious.  One of the funniest rom coms in a while but also with sweet moments.  This is one of my fave modern rom coms.


The Big Sick on Amazon-If youve never seen The Big Sick watch this movie!  Based on Kumail and Emilys real life story/romance.  This is funny, heartfelt and just incredibly well done.


Always Be My Maybe on Netflix if you havent seen it is another good one.  Fairly straightforward but really well done.


The Lovebirds on Netflix is hilarious and not a typical rom com-sort of an action/adventure rom com-but its great.


The Rewrite (maybe still on Hulu?) is fairly old now but an underrated more recent rom com with Hugh Grant.  


Sleeping with Other People with Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie is SUPER RAUNCHY but its funny and has some sweet moments.  I didnt love the first 15 minutes on a first watch but now I love this movie.


The Broken Hearts Gallery is a super typical rom com but a fun watch.  Recommend.


The new Marry Me movie on Peacock isnt super funny but definitely gives off 2000s vibe rom com.  Like a cross between Music and Lyrics and Notting Hill (with less humor).  Still a good watch.",16/2/2022 16:34,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5596769582618639,1,0.2059421710365107,1.0

Understandably so, as there are plenty of stinkers out there under the 'romcom' banner. This however isn't one of those, no this is a charming and impressive directorial debut by Natalie Krinksy. It is genuinely funny and filled with numerous laugh out loud moments. It's witty and intelligent and portrays a world that's easy to get engrossed in, as it's populated by a cast of bright and diverse characters who are easy to love.

There is plenty to admire and enjoy here, particularly when acknowledging it's a debut effort. But given few things in cinema are perfect, there are a few (mostly minor) negatives to acknowledge so let's do that first. Whilst the soundtrack of the film is inoffensive and there's nothing egregiously wrong with it, I'm also personally not the biggest fan of mass produced modern pop and it did feel moderately out of place on a few occasions. Whilst by no means frequent, there are also moments when the dialogue feels somewhat sloppy. Occasionally feeling stilted, and in a few moments somewhat cheesy. However this is far from the norm and on the whole The Broken Hearts Gallery is excellently written, managing dialogue that feels at once grounded and real whilst retaining some stylised and elevated elements. Plus aside from anything else, the comedic beats in the film are largely hilarious, frequent and well timed. The only other criticism worth noting, is that the film does occasionally lose focus leading to infrequent moments of messiness. These briefly pose the question of where we're going or the exact purpose of a couple of scenes. This isn't a major detractor or common across the film's runtime, the vast majority of which is slickly and stylishly directed whilst always retaining its aforementioned charm and heart.

It is that all encompassing charm that carries this, When Harry Met Sally for the hipster age a very long way. Whilst I don't think TBHG is quite on the level of the great Rob Reiner movie, that is hardly surprising given WHMS is the gold standard for romance based comedy. This film certainly owes a debt of gratitude to WHMS and has echoes of its DNA, most plainly emphasised by its cute social media styled intermediate video vignettes which break up the film; much in the same way as our check ins with friendly elderly couples in WHMS, just in an updated format. By no means should my comparisons between the two movies be seen as a criticism or diminishing what has been created here, quite the opposite in fact I mean to pay both TBHG and Natalie Krinsky a sincere compliment. Certainly the film stands on its own two feet with confidence, and possesses several unique elements with which Krinsky makes the film her own.

One of these unique elements that gives the film its own flavour, are the stylised and superbly choreographed breaks in the film's traditional storytelling. Best exemplified by a sweet moment in the first act, when our main character Lucy is comforted after a typical romcom bad break up. Said moment is filmed in an immaculately choreographed and stylish series of slowed down shots, which serves to accentuate the moment. There are several of these choreographed moments, they're fun, whimsical and visually splendid. They give the film, which moves at an otherwise brisk pace, a chance to breathe.

We are of course retreading some familiar ground here in places, which I feel rather goes with the territory. I fear romantic comedy is one of the genres that is rather challenging to totally innovate within. All your classic elements can be found here, bad break ups, a typical 'will they, won't they' dynamic, scenes of our love interests in separate locations but rushing to meet one another, grand gestures (which are acknowledged within the film in a tongue in cheek, self aware fashion) and big romantic monologues. Despite this it does retain a feeling of freshness, and despite being predictable that's no bad thing and it never feels cliched.

The cinematography on display was a nice highlight. It's not standard or stale, which goes a long way to giving it a visual identity. Shot in a warm, rich and neony (totally a word!) colour palette, it feels cosy and suits the movie's tone to a tee. There are numerous shots taken from interesting angles, and some shot at non-standard speeds. The shot selection and visual language, which Krinsky and cinematographer Alar Kivilo have created is impressive and polished. 

All that is good and enjoyable here is best encapsulated and personified, by TBHG's wonderful cast of which there are no weak links. Geraldine Viswanathan (as Lucy) and Dacre Montgomery (as Nick) are both incredibly endearing, putting in electric performances in the lead roles. Viswanathan in particular is equal parts smart, charming, funny and fierce, a powerful and independent woman and wonderful to see in this kind of film. Honourable mentions also go to Molly Gordon (as Amanda) and Phillipa Soo (as Nadine), who bring an edge and some dark humour to their supporting roles which is most pleasing. Arturo Castro too is funny and disarming in his role as Nick's best friend Marcos. There is an easy and joyous camaraderie between everyone on screen together for much of the movie. Bernadette Peters is pitch perfect casting as pretentious and glamorous gallery owner Eva Woolf. Not forgetting to mention Nathan Dale as Jeff, who has a quietly humorous build up to his character throughout the movie and who's pay off is one of the funniest gags in the whole film.

So in short, I would highly go recommend anyone to go and see this provided it is safe in your location to visit the cinema. To support a talented filmmaker's debut and just to have a much needed, feel good fun time. It's well written, sharply paced and has a talented and hilarious cast. The cinematic needs more efforts like this, films which pay homage to and have classic cinema's DNA but do something uniquely their own with it. Whilst the cycle of cinematic sequels, reboots and remakes do produce good stuff, I feel films like The Broken Hearts Gallery are a sign we can have balance in cinema and I truly hope it does well.",4/10/2020 21:12,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5579931616252373,1,0.2305378356793452,1.0

The trailer promised a tasteless exploitation film and on that level it met my expectations. 

 Remaking Die Hard with a school shooting as backdrop is one of the worst ideas for a film I've ever heard of and this film is just as bonkers as I expected.  What I didn't expect was the level of professional polish it has.  The direction by Kyle Rankin is solid work.  The performances, with the exception of that lead school shooter, were strong.  

I didn't like that lead boy because his performance didn't match the established tone.  He seems to be drawing his inspiration from Heath Ledger's Joker and Alan Rickman in Die Hard.  Way too hammy for my tastes.  

Another head-scratching idea was to include Zoey's dead mother as a character to dialogue with.  It didn't work at all for me.  

And, that ending was sickening.  In the end, she becomes just as ruthless as the terrorists.  She finds the Joker kid in a creek and decides to blow a hole through his chest.  She grabs her father's hunting rifle to do it,which recalls the opening scene.  Unlike that scene though, she decides not to finish him and just leaves him to die a slow, agonizing death.   This instantly made her just as corrupt as the shooters and it just turned my stomach.  

This movie has a pretty despicable worldview. I suppose my reaction makes me a woke liberal or whatever.",17/2/2022 23:17,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6522222222222224,1,-0.29333333333333333,0.0

When most people think AI they think along the lines of the Terminator and androids, which makes it seem like this far future thing, not something that we already have and is already affecting our daily lives. The immediate danger of AI isn't that it will become sentient, it is more that it isn't sentient (in that it can't think or analyse more abstract human ideas). Via recommendation AIs we have a world being heavily affected, minute by minute, by something that doesn't understand or take into account the consequences of it's actions.

It does sensationalise it a bit in the cringey dramatisations, but then social media has helped create a world where most people will only pay attention to sensationalised information.

The ultimate takeaway I got from the social dilemma wasn't that Facebook and Twitter etc are evil companies hellbent on rigging elections and turning people into hate machines (morally bankrupt yes, but it is a lot easier to make those decisions when you are massively detached from the people they will affect, or don't really understand the affects it will have). More that they are incompetent and are using technology they can't really control (most AIs are black box when it comes to how they made a specific decision, we can see the data but it rarely makes sense to a human) and refuse to put it back in the box because they have to keep making higher and higher profits to please shareholders. Which also explains why efforts to curb the spread of fake news has mostly been manual, how do you teach an AI what truth is? As good as they are at working towards a scorable goal they still don't think, they can't critically analyse what they recommend. They recommend fake news because they don't know the difference, people are more likely to read sensationalised headlines and fake news tends to be more sentionalized.

As was noted at the end of the doc they need to be forced to stop using this stuff via regulation, no way will their shareholder ever let them do it for the good of the people.",3/10/2020 14:12,0.0,,0.0,0.5276422764227643,1,,

Morbius is at least so bad its almost good. I mean man, what a dumb movie. Matt Smith looks like hes having fun in like, three scenes at least.

Suicide Squad is a fun bad movie - what are we, some kinda suicide squad sums it up. Also most of the cast actually give genuinely good/fun performances (Jared Leto Joker and a few others are a hot mess though) IMO so youll get some legit enjoyment.

Personally though, my favorite bad movie is easily Venom. Is it quite possibly the stupidest thing Ive ever watched? Yes. Did I have an absolute blast watching it? Hell yes. Tom hardy is just so much fun, this is definitely my go to, so bad its good pick.

In Aladdin for example, when Jasmine is in the Market. In the original the guy was threatening to cut off her hand for stealing. A stereotypical, but very real thing during that time period on that area of the world. This created a very real and emotional motive for Aladdin to jump in and risk his life to save her hand. 

In the remake the guy just threatens to take her necklace/jewelry as payment. Like...yeah you should pay for what you stole. Maybe he was taking more than what the apple was worth, but it didn't seem nearly as big of a deal. 

In an effort to diminish a stereotype, they watered down that scene and many other scenes in this movie and others. 

In the original Mulan, the fact Mulan was a woman meant her place in Chinese society was as a wife/homemaker. She was a very strong character with motivations to save her family and struggles in her military training to uphold her family honor and save her father. There was a multifaceted motivation for what she was doing and a lot of societal subtext about a woman's role in their society. 

The Mulan remake lacked any subtext. It was all in your face and ""she's a woman she can't do that."" They also made her character kind of a Mary Sue stereotype was was good at everything she did and still looked down upon robbing her character of agency and the actual struggles of her decisions. Mulan on the live action remake was this amazing warrior woman who didn't struggle in battle at all which diminishes her character entirely. Mulan in the original didn't want to go to war, but did it to save her father. Mulan in the remake was like ""I'm the best warrior on the planet I want to go to war.""",2/1/2023 19:12,0.0,,0.0,0.4764444444444445,0,,

It didnt have a bs promotion. The director of the live action said she would work with experts in Chinese culture to make sure that Mulan was as authentic as possible.


So that kind of sets the expectation, dont you think?

In all my work that is centered in cultures not my own, I hope that comes through because that is incredibly important to me.

In the promotion and PR thats what theyve been emphasizing. So they over promised and underdelivered.

Should I have ignored the PR? Sure. But I didnt. I went into the film with that mindset.

Can I forget about it and suspend my disbelief? Sure.

In the end, I am disappointed, because it had a lot of potential for being a good remake or a good reimagining and it was neither.

The cultural appropriation is insult to injury. Lots of things in the movie that makes people familiar with the culture scratch their head.

Cinema has a history of exploiting culture for its foreign exoticism. And in 2020, Disney is still did it with Mulan.

Culture. Mythology. History. Etc.

Its important because its a peoples culture butchered by a person who clearly doesnt understand or butcher it.

This was one of the most generic and painful films to sit through. I love Liam Neeson, I give him slack because hes always seemed like a good guy. But boy is he in some numbers.

This movie struggles to communicate with the audience properly. The dialogue is straight out of a Grade 10 English class. The acting fits the bill too, even Neeson who doesnt give much to this role. Jai Courtneys character is so childish and batshit insane. Courtney completely overacts his part in this and it comes off almost childlike. The movie consists mostly of him offing off his colleagues and then Neeson calling his SO baby at the beginning and end of every sentence, like a broken record.

No one is criticizing a movie that wouldve brought attention to what took place, Pre civil war time. But creating a movie, in which a modern day, slave worked plantation exists, is beyond ridiculous. Its nothing but woke liberal psycho babble horse shit. It would never exist, in modern times and making an entire movie based on that total fabrication is nothing but pure propaganda. 

You comparing it to making a movie about the Holocaust is nowhere near an accurate comparison and extremely insensitive. This trash movie was made in the current time and Ive never seen a movie about the Holocaust, that didnt take place in the years of which the Holocaust took place. 

So, you see, that is the issue with this woke trash and its just another one of the fifty movies that have come out, in the past couple years that focus on white peoples bad and black peoples courageous and heroic. Everyone is sick and tired of this same subject matter being pushed and promoted in everything from movies, advertising, sports and the list got on. Its like our society just cant focus on the now and has to just constantly make the sad attempt to act like racism is stronger than ever. Its just not true and continuing to promote it, is unproductive and results in further division. 

A little unity would be nice and admitting that racism is not consuming our country would be a great direction to go. Racism is not some HUGE issue, plaguing modern day America. Equality exists and everyone is given the same opportunities, if they are willing to work hard and be an honest/productive member of society. 

Do you here Jewish people criticizing and blaming current day Germany for the Holocaust?  No, of course you dont, because that would be absurd.  Dont you find it interesting that something as tragic as the Holocaust, is not held over the head of modern day Germany but slavery in America, is still largely blamed on modern day white people in America?  To be honest, both times in history were horrible and shouldve never happened but keeping alive the lie that white people of today should feel responsible or accountable is pure insanity and fantasy. Just like you would never tell a modern day Germany that they are at fault for the Holocaust. 

If youd like to share with us a modern day movie that depicts Germans as current Day Holocaust members, Id love to check that movie out.  I will wait, with the crickets and tumbleweeds because we both know, no such movie exists.  And it will never exist because its completely insensitive to German people and paints them in a picture that is completely unfair.
