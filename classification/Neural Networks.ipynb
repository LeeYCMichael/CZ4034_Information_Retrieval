sure if its just because Chadwick Boseman wasnt in it but felt that the story itself was bland and unfortunately as per usual with new marvel stuff the visual effects just werent great at all loved

still confident in that brand power But they re diluting it by putting out poor films with poor scripts Honestly m amazed they didn go with the most obvious plot given the premise sort of Pacific Rim type film where human society has cordoned itself off from the threat of dinosaurs learned to live with that with that status quo collapsing when dinosaurs break into human spaces If not that then an Escape From New York kind of premise having to rescue people from one of the many long abandoned metropolitans now totally overrun with dinosaurs with recognisable spaces like Times Square or Brooklyn

but it gets bogged down by having so many balls to juggle especially the stuff about the whales which gets introduced like minutes into the movie In some ways it has the feeling of an overly faithful book adaptation The first movie in comparison was lot more stream lined with very simple plot understand what they were going for in the main story Jake learning the costly lesson that running away won protect his family echoed in the tulkun way of pacifism that likewise is doomed to fail but perhaps it could have been tightened up wee bit was bit confused by Spider particularly after he gets

Top Gun Maverick was such massive success last year mean yes it was sensational movie in its own right but people also flocked to see it because for the first time in what felt like ages we had huge summer blockbuster that was made with heart and passion rather than more soulless superhero schlock made to make money ', 'If you watched any featurette in the years leading up to the movie you knew exactly what to expect from Top Gun Maverick in good way It a solid action movie simple plot but the entertainment comes from how they filmed it and knowing that you were seeing mostly real flying

huge MCU Star Wars action movie fan in general but Top Gun Maverick was truly one of the best films saw in years Its such feel good pure adrenaline rush of movie Fantastic actors amazing soundtrack

got nationalism and Tom Cruise who is the type of movie star that lot of people voters love Black Panther while very good better than TG imo doesnt have that history with the general public outside of comic readers and is more of genre film That racism more backlash for Black Panther while Top Gun Maverick gets praised Also its worth noting that lot of academy voters are older and Top Gun Maverick

potential problems being brought up but either they were never mentioned again or it was just solved within seconds It still has very good cinematography and picture but honestly expected more from

an amazing plot it can possibly be of value All that to say Avatar rocked People need to just have fun Same with Top Gun Maverick They are theater experience movies Their plot is not the driving force

were few Top Gun Maverick The Outfit and The Pale Blue Eye were probably my top three movies of Moonfall See How They Run The Adam Project and Bullet Train were all in my second tier clearly flawed

Dumbledore was pretty good The storyline was bit hard to follow but like Mads Mikkelsen as Grindelwald way better than Johnny Depp He plays villain better Also it didnt end super depressing ', 'I think this concept could have been done without it getting so far into the dark realm of pedos and kids having their limbs blown off It would have for example been interesting to see someone who is the leader of failed army or nation go back and make different choices only to see things drastically change and not for the better Thematic ideas could be about how fragile everything is and how

action ', 'After watching Puss in Boots realized that hate most of the recent Disney and Pixar offerings because they just feel like student indie films Like don know what the medium of animation

it had smaller release it would be received much more positively It a great movie at its baseline It like The Menu or The Green Knight When no one knew about them they were very well received thought they were incredible THEN the mainstream came in and it just focuses on all the dumbest things It makes you realize how little people opinion matters in large numbers because there so much confirmation bias ', 'No it doesnt Turning Red was better written and way more original', 'Turning Red is fun movie ', 'I mean Turning Red is this person favorite Pixar movie so that is pretty much implied ', 'Im sorry amp didnt hate Turning Red by any extent but Puss In Boots clears Turning Red multiple times over', 'Completely agree Turning Red is pretty mid Pixar film imo but thats also by

seems to be beloved by most people and it was mistake to make it streaming only Bad Guys was fine and have not seen Puss in Boots but going by the Box Office its an absolute smash do want to see it eventually Turning Red seems to be on its way to becoming classic Pixar film There is groundswell of support for this movie from many critics and tons of fans Disney completely bungled this release and seems to be kneecapping Pixar by not releasing their films theatrically don know why Turning Red seems to be polarizing outside the fact that some people find puberty icky even if we all go through it in our own different ways d love to see the Best Animated feature race to be more than Pixar award and hope it goes to something like Marcel Pinocchio or Puss Boots but think folks are overexaggerating based on two mediocre releases and PnB being an unexpected smash hit mean Lightyear and The Bad Guys made about the same amount of money theatrically and outside of posts on this exact topic don see people really talking about The Bad Guys unless their kids are really into it ', 'Turning Red was great and probably overall better film than The Bad Guys and Puss in Boots But do love the art style in both Dreamworks films this year It nice to see genuine strong aesthetic vision Although to that point Turning Red also felt significantly more stylised compared to Pixars other recent films also strongly suspect Strange World will have undergo slight reappraisal over the next decade or so like Treasure Planet Atlantic have Its good little film ', 'TIL turning red had mixed response lol It was universally loved', 'Turning Red is fucking awesome', 'The Conversation Ladybird Turning Red just don like The Conversation at all find it incredibly dull and boring That just my opinion Ladybird was good but it wasn THAT GOOD think it lost itself in the ending and it could ve used bit of work but overall still good movie Turning Red is also pretty alright movie but again not worth It decent but not great ', 'Some of these animation movies that my kids love but just put on for the heck of it like Sing amp Turning Red and the Trolls movies ', 'I dont see how Netflix or

epics which hasnt been the case for years The best actor lists are great Thank God the animation list has some actually good animated movies and isnt just another Disney Pixar pile up Turning Red is

wasn that bad but it doesn quite stack up against Turning Red GDT Pinocchio or Puss in Boots', 'My ranking for animated pictures go as Marcel The Shell with Shoes On GDT Pinocchio Puss in Boots The Last Wish Turning Red Haven seen The Sea Beast but as far as writing goes it gotta contend with Pinocchio and Marcel and as far as animation goes Pinocchio is superb and Puss is downright gorgeous ',

probably their only good film they released ', 'No doubt the movie was made well but at its core the character is not the Joker Had the character been anyone other than the Joker Id agree with your points but to make them the Joker totally changes the dynamic with Batman If they ever introduced Batman to this Jokers universe the audience would be wondering why deranged vigilante is beating mentally ill man who was victim of his tragic upbringing and surroundings Youd feel bad for the Joker every time hes hauled off to jail by the Batman when in reality you should never feel empathy for the Joker and his actions ', 'The Batman What piece of shit ', 'So long as The Batman with Pattinson stays in its own secluded universe by itself and they let none of the extended DCU shit touch it

because the Joker was transformed into an incel who were supposed to empathize with because he has mommy issues Do we not excuse his murderous behavior because of his past trauma The worst part was when he was carried out of police car as Christ like figure Give me Agent of Chaos Joker any day One that lacks empathy and only exists to oppose everything the Batman represents ', 'I mean The Batman was good movie Not flawless but good The Snyderverse was shit and tried watching DKR and just couldn find any shits to give about it ', 'Wait wait wait Are they seriously just xeroxing Spiderman No Way Home When are they going to stop doing hollow copies of whatever Marvel did year ago The Batman was great why can they just make more movies like that ', 'Youre correct If this movie didnt have the Batman crossover it wouldnt have seen the light of day People wondering how this could have happened this is why Its disgusting ultimately especially when they start to parade Ezra Miller around in public But they want the nostalgia Batman dollar', 'Honestly nothing can get me excited for DCU Batman The Batman was so good doubt anything is going to top that ', 'I dont know man it was lot of fun The underwater scenes were impressive and the whole cast did great job especially Patrick Wilson and Willem Dafoe know Joker and The Batman were better received but those were too dour for me like comic book movies that feel more silly and dont take themselves so seriously But definitely understand why people prefer the darker stuff', 'It probably isn but it there not exactly incredibly stiff competition Assuming everything in the DC universe is being considered the best movies since TDK off the top of my head are IMO in some order Wonder Woman Suicide Squad Joker The Batman Shazam The Dark Knight Rises and Birds of Prey Of all of these d say The Batman SS and Joker are tier above the others with The Batman being my personal best The Batman was definitely really good but have it notch below TDK so by my calculus The Flash only needs to be close to that good So yeah there no fucking chance this movie is going to be that good ', 'James Gunn explained the plan pretty well few weeks ago This movie is meant to reset the new dcu called chapter gods and monsters There is also the elsewhere movies Joker The Batman fall into this world It doesn touch the dcu stories HBO shows

slowly developing more of hate for humanity or those how saw him as weak or crippled Matt Smith was enjoyable to watch as bad guy just running amok doing whatever he wanted The movie wasn terrible ve seen far worse So what the deal here It wasn the greatest film by any means but definitely an enjoyable popcorn action movie liked all the bat and flying around special effects thought it was overall

me the tonal shift to more sombre less out there take for prequel makes more sense to me especially given the time period and it being the beginning meaning you can have chronological order that works

actually has interesting things to say and evolves the universe in exciting ways while also giving lot more depth into Neo and Trinity as character totally get why lot of people didn like it the action wasn particularly great or even matrix like the tone was very different almost more of comedy at times beloved characters are recast for some reasons more legitimate than others and can be perceived as just having super cynical tone about its own existence But don see it as cyinical in that way It is cynical about the movie industry in general but it goes on to offer much more sincere

what it isn ', 'Idk if hated this movie or the matrix resurrections more Its hard toss up ', 'I will die on the hill the Matrix Resurrections is great because it bad The movie makes no effort to hide

for fifth movie You want to see Neo fight against the machines Fuck you Trinity is the hero of this story You liked cold machine like Agent Smith Fuck you now he acts like normal person You thought it

major blockbuster films overuse green screens rather than using practical sets and props Thats one reason why liked Ghostbusters Afterlife CGI wasnt too great but it relied more on practical effects In contrast thought the CGI in the Fantastic Beasts movies was pretty awful on the creatures Newt looks like hes trying to pet bird or something but his hand is still kind of in mid air It never looked like the creatures were even there think it was the result of bad composite shot or something like that mostly chalked it up to very limited time frame to get the effects done also partially

created Freaks amp Geeks and directed Bridesmaids The caliber of talent involved should have turned in much better movie but that didnt happen Its crazy though the exact opposite of your sad little boycott happened with Afterlife Especially with the psychos on the Ghostbusters sub They decided they loved it long before it came out They had entire threads talking about how they knew they were gonna ugly cry when they saw the original Ghostbusters on screen again Thats just the other stupid extreme of boycotting the film If you watch them both with an open mind you realize that theyre both just bad movies but Afterlife is bad in way that is infinitely more offensive than the way ATC is bad ', 'Ahh had feeling thats what it was about but didnt know of the subtitle Yeah was much better than Afterlife as lifelong Ghostbusters fan didnt hate it when it came out and enjoy it even more after seeing Afterlife ', 'Hot take Afterlife is even worse than ATC ATC is comedy that lands maybe of

if youre talking about movies that are literally part of the Ghostbusters franchise ', 'Ghostbusters Afterlife Ghostbusters II and Ghostbusters Answer the Call are pale imitations of Ghostbusters but theyre still recognizable as Ghostbusters movies Ghostbusters Afterlife on the other hand is tonally incompatible with its predecessors Its derivative of Stranger Things which itself is derivative of the works of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King Its an emotionally manipulative dramady for kids and man children in series of improv based comedies And worst of all its an obvious course correction from ATC but its actually worse They learned all the wrong lessons from that movies many failings ', 'Resident Evil Afterlife felt like Paul S Anderson was just giving up on even pretending to have story Also Fuck it ll just say it Halloween sucks ', 'I initially didnt want to watch it because the trailers made it to look so stupid But F at the time saw it in the theater with my mom because she really wanted to go ended up loving the movie in it so stupid its funny sort of way Probably helps that hadnt yet seen the original at the time also prefer it over Afterlife but Ill still watch the next one when it comes out ', 'Not his last great film but one that really enjoyed was Always It was fun movie about friendship love afterlife and heartbreak great classic in my book ', 'I LOVED this

moment and he had no idea Is it streaming anywhere do you know ', 'Ghostbusters Afterlife grew up watching and re watching the originals Answer the Call was disappointing when it came out So then got little excited when heard that this one was better Except it just isn It ended and thought That was really good And with every successive thought about it the movie got worse and worse And now it has settled in as the worst of the Ghostbusters movies imo The originals were powered by creative people at the peak of their talents This one is well funded fan fiction Say what you want about the one but at least they tried some new things don like it but my daughter at least does So maybe m not the target audience anymore ', 'Ghostbusters Afterlife None of the characters are really charming takes forever for the story to get going the original introduced its leads and fleshed them out quickly this one takes more than an hour and only really Phoebe is three dimensional and even though there some comedy and jokes it plays itself too serious trying to make the Ghostbusters story into this grand saga instead of the really fun comedy it is', 'there doesn need to be shining sequel this is pure monetization won watch nor remotely interested in vitiating classic experience and content by watching monetized cut out film hope it takes bath if tree falls in forest Will be sure to watch the

was WAY too packed with stuff and could easily have been trimmed down bit like the characters enough but they tried to do too much with way too much and couldn fit all that they wanted into the movie think my favorite part is that they don do the slow mo for the super speed sequences That was just straight up cool to have super speed actually be super speed ', ' Planet Dune Like heard lot of hype about the reboot And it was cool they got Sean young in it but idk maybe m missing something ', 'Lack of rich color Ive been watching lot of movies lately especially horror science fiction and fantasy

black and white and it wouldnt have made huge difference And yes the Planet Dune shouldnt be colorful but even Caladan and Giedi Prime lacked distinctive color Every costume seemed like it was either black or white earth tone ', 'It was visually spectacular and really really enjoyed all the spaceships architecture furniture etc The audio was pretty excellent too But overall felt it was really boring actually found myself midway through googling to see how long it was felt like the pacing was really off Also lot of characters that are important in the book had incredibly fleeting roles in the film Personally think characters should be done justice or just cut entirely Oh and for lethal desert planet dune never felt hot get that there is lot of world building to do and that that takes time but it felt like the movie was almost entirely world building with only tiny bit of plot to hold it together ', 'It hard to tell read the book many times before The basic story of the first book is somewhat easily understood but the overarching story that ist hinted in the first book will get only few sentences in this movie which is understandable but it means that there are important moments one can miss The beginning can get somewhat confusing for some moviegoers because the movie has to introduce lot of the political players and the way the universe works in this story think the movie did great job but one has to give every moment of this movie their full attention and that is not given with every type of moviegoer The book gives you ton of more details and you ll understand more of what is happening in the background of the story on the planet Dune but don think you have to read the book before seeing the movie it is very faithful to the story and only took somewhat superficial liberties here and there If you are really interested in the story go read the book as soon as you can if you are not sure go see the movie and decied after that don think you ll lose something watching the movie first before reading the book or the other way around ', 'Why does every movie have to be epic Dune is story that grows from that one little planet Dune into galactic wide

translation If instead of avenges his family and recaptures the planet Doon it had said seeks to avenge his family and recapture the planet Dune it would have been alright ', 'I can say they are what would have envisioned but they are certainly interesting Of course their garb would probably change lot depending if they were on their ship or down on the planet dune potentially in still suit ', 'There was lot in the book that didn translate well to the movies Things like heart plugs and the societies of the planets the space folding and the bene gesserits They did their best with it for the film so they could focus on the planet Dune and the conflict there but the books explained all that stuff better think retelling with more streamed like story will be better Not focusing on the larger universe and focusing instead on the main conflict look forward to the attempt ', 'The Spine of Night is easily one of my recent favorites if youre into dark fantasy cosmic horror rotoscoped animation ', 'Seconded for Robot Carnival Theres dub available plus anime isnt just one art style thats just mostly TV shows and certain genres of films Robot Carnival is an anthology series few of the shorts

'Well Ive seen two in the last week The Spine of Night and Mad God And honestly m having really hard time picking one as better m leaning towards Mad God but keep questioning myself too So yea its one of those two d recommend jazz cabbage at minimum for either however some psychedelics know cannabis is technically psychedelic but m talking mushroom or acid strength psychs are really what both call for Both are really good examples of rarer animation forms rotoscoping for Spine of Night and stop motion for Mad God and both are very much so treat for the eyes though Mad God may qualify as nightmarish treat ', 'I thought Wolfwalkers Klaus and The Spine of Night were pretty good dont know what this obsession with Disney animation is theyve been mainly making CGI animation for years and

moment was so cool m massive Dark Souls Bloodborne Elden Ring fan And for some reason the whole film felt like lore video explaining the world of one of their games There also guy in it who looks like he has the Mask of the Father from Dark Souls and Key of the Embedded from Dark Souls If you re into that series you ll know what mean ', 'I just got done watching Nova Seed and it pretty damn good The Spine of Night is an AMAZING adult fantasy done in the rotoscope style of old Bakshi movies and it on the short list of my favorite films of Phil Tippet Mad God is disgusting but beautiful go

great director Antlers especially was great theatre experience for me personally Been lots of well made horror movies lately any favourites that youve seen recently ', 'Antlers was great and recommend it highly m glad that it a film you stand behind found it because of Graham Greene and not because of the horror genre btw ', 'Managed to see this one in theater before it Netflix release Honestly while there are some really cool aspects there are lot of wasted opportunities in this film Scott Cooper has proven he is good director with good films like Crazy Heart Black Mass and Hostiles which in my opinion are really underappreciated and rarely spoken about His previous work Antlers was honestly pretty bad and The Pale Blue Eye despite having amazing camera work and an interesting concept it was slog love period piece stories and the idea of investigating series of murders with Edgar Allen Poe is cool concept and it could have been interesting Unfortunately the narrative barely takes full advantage of its creative ideas since the story felt wooden and ends up being messy which made me doze off at certain moments Despite having strong start the messy narrative and direction doesnt make the film better and makes the film uneven and sloppy Surprisingly don know if its just me Despite having great cast the performances are mix of good and bad Some performances like Christian Bale and Gillian Anderson were really great but others felt wooden or extremely silly The production camerawork and soundtrack is great Some dialogue moments were pretty good But the positive moments are

you are not aware of Army of the Damned lol Thats how it was for our group were we just saw neat heist movie and said sure why not The little scenes talking about zombie apocalypse going on across the seas just like it some kind of offhand news tidbit felt so surreal like wtf why is this not bigger deal It made finding out about the sequel absolutely hilarious that thats the direction the series went in was kinda sad to find out that Army of Thieves was actually the newer movie because that would have been power play of direction for heist movie to go ', 'Army of Thieves was fantastic prequel

they walked out of this movie makes me think they don like Wes Anderson style and most likely never will There nothing crazy about The French Dispatch compared to his other recent works If people dislike the seperate stories approach so be it but to say it pretentious and terrible is more commentary on Wes than the movie itself In short don rely on reactionary Redditors to tell you what is and what isn good If you like Wes you ll at least be okay with this movie can see people saying it not his best but to say it terrible is just plain wrong From scene to scene it got all the classic

must go into it am very curious to see where his career goes Hes relatively young man do we just have more movies in that same style Attempt to do something in more traditional style How interesting

after watching The French Dispatch Im huge Wes Anderson fan and was like damn man maybe little too Wes Anderson in this one', 'I wont pretend that every part of his latest films have been perfect but vehemently disagree with people saying that hes indulging in style over substance The French Dispatch dealt delicately and deftly with themes of sexism criminal justice artistry and how it connects to the psyche of those who practice it racism homophobia and most prominently the impact journalistic reporting on those issues has on the world at large and the people who report of them You could argue that it tackled them in skin deep capacity if you want but honestly what care most about is whether how he tackles it rings true or not And do genuinely think it does As said will admit that not every creative choice made in The French Dispatch worked out in its favor really the last article with its contents depicted is the only time felt like the black and white with occasional splashes of color

the French Dispatch even if it wasn my favorite Anderson film It knew exactly what it was trying to be and largely it succeeded The film is caricature of the self important world of film art food

that exactly how those type of people see themselves Was it perfect No The Private Dining Room of the Police Commissioner gets bit off the rails during the kidnapping scene though the talk show

of his craft doing EXACTLY what he wants to and for VERY niche audience dont think he needs to tone it down to get seen or appreciated Spielberg is confidant and benefactor of his And Id say the style

know this was originally written for the stage but it makes sense The songs are great and they have that authentic feel that only songs written for live performance have Ironically dont think went for the ones was supposed to The one that hes struggling to write through the first two acts and the one that serves as the big finish were two of my least favorites My favorite was probably the very first one So this is the next good Netflix original agree that most of their stuff isnt good but this year theyve been averaging about one month for me that are worth watching The last one of theirs

level of production that it did Someone didn think that one all the way through and made Black Mirror episode for kids ', 'I loved The Mitchells Vs The Machines Very funny good story just really good all around just recently watched Ron Gone Wrong from Fox It was good one too ', 'The Mitchells vs The Machines thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am glad Danny McBride was cast as Rick Mitchell Good message about social media and technology infiltrating people lives The action sequences were fun and the sound design was really good with lots of surround effects and impactful bass d give it out of As side note if you ve seen this movie and are looking for similarly enjoyable animated movie can recommend Ron Gone Wrong highly enough ', 'If you don mind kids humor and animation enjoyed Ron Gone Wrong ', ' Nightcrawler Ron Gone Wrong haven watched Nightcrawler since it came out on Blu Ray in early Man forgot just how well Jake Gyllenhaal played creepy and psychotic sociopathic character Just watching him be walking textbook for business and management yet missing the all important ability to actually connect and empathize with others is kind of disturbing The addition of Riz Ahmed was definitely bonus Highly recommended Ron Gone Wrong was quite surprising It started off bit cheesy but quickly established itself for what it is think it did good job of showing how social media addiction can affect everyone especially younger pre teens and teens Some pretty hilarious parts as well It was one that parents can enjoy just as much if not more than kids It worth watch ', 'Obviously late to this party but just caught The Beta Test and wanted to say how much we liked it Very compelling to say the least Jordan was mesmerizing character what an amazing acting job We will be checking out your other two movies asap and be on the lookout for your projects from now on', 'Recently quite enjoyed The Beta Test ', 'the beta test is amazing', 'Jim just finished watching The Beta Test Brilliant film and you were great in it Great indictment of where our culture is at today though it was also very funny Some of the most uncomfortable moments reminded me of vintage Altman the absurdist mixed with utter tragedybut not without that dark humor There was shot or two that seemed to be homages to The Player plus the story line of the envelope very similar to Tim Robbins getting the anonymous postcards Think your film really requires second viewing to let all the layers really get into you So much goes by and so quickly that Im definitely going to have to watch it again Incredible filmthank you ', 'I really loved The Beta Test as comedic thriller but havent heard anyone praise it at all Perhaps it was just me who liked it or saw it for that matter ', 'The Beta Test is more experimental psycho sexual noir Modern but has decent amount of noir mystery elements ', 'My thoughts are this guy and Vanishing Angle are making the best films at the best price and doing it all in house It incredible It is true testament that if you want to make movie you can make movie loved Thunder Road It what you want out of film Make you laugh and kind of feel When he goes to see his ex for the last time Hilarious The Wolf of Snow Hollow was fun watch It cracked me up When he says We re going to need the phone records and rips the whole phone off the desk wraps the cord around it and walks away You can see his influences shine there The Beta Test was good but was more impressed with the overall feat of making film like that rather than the film itself There a movie called Shimmer Lake that think you would like if you enjoy his movies or my stuff ', 'If you havent seen them recommend Jim Cummings other movies too The Wolf of Snow Hollow and the Beta Test same type of energy both are great', 'The Beta Test looks good ', 'The Beta Test was the silliest movie saw this year which is memorable in its own way but what bad movie xDDD', 'Definitely agree Thought The Beta Test was great ', 'The first minutes of The Beta Test would drive you insane', 'This was going to be my contribution actually liked the beta test theres scene at the end where he confessed everything to his wife with similar unhinged desperate vibe ', 'Go watch the Beta Test this dude plays breakdowns so phenomenally fucking well ', 'It bloody brilliant Thunder road was even better The Beta Test Perfection Jim Cummings is genius', 'I just found this thread searching for reviews discussion of the movie So cool to see you engaging directly with fans here rented The Beta Test Thursday loved it and actually enjoyed it so much watched it again Friday before the rental expired This was my first movie of yours so now do need to go back and check out the others Anyway what think is the most impressive thing here is the balancing act you pull off Jordan is of course despicable person but as viewer loved watching him and found the whole movie hilarious How do you thread that needle of making the character both likable and unlikable at the same time without turning off the audience ', 'I just finished watching the Beta Test really liked it It great that subject like infidelity esp fuelled by the internet was tackled in such riveting way It captures the spirit of the times With so many billionaires getting divorced seems like the sanctity of marriage is falling apart This is wake up call', 'Hey Yeah checked out The Beta Test while on vacation last week and that led me to look for anything else youve made first TWOSH and just finished watching Thunder Road Its so good Im looking forward to whatever you make next ', 'Possessor is great Incredibly violent so be prepared if thats what youre going to pick The Beta Test is good but as much comedy as it is thriller Its really satire about Hollywood agents just told through the prism of thriller plot If youve seen other films by Jim Cummings the lead actor and co writer director ie Thunder Road and the Wolf of Snow Hollow that will give you pretty good indication of whether youll like the Beta Test ', 'I really liked Jim Cummings new film The Beta Test but the purple color grade to match the production design gives everyone really weird skin tones', 'How do you deal with the pressure that comes from first time financial backing particularly on something like the Thunder Road feature guess you can call it imposter syndrome but the leap from short to feature feels impossible not necessarily from funding standpoint but in the actual logistics of production that large What kind of headspace were you in going into production on the Thunder Road feature Also watched The Beta Test truly remarkable Jim dont know how you keep doing it ', 'The Beta Test Very thought provoking and just wicked funny', 'Halloween kills is nowhere near as good as the the reboot', 'That have to be Halloween Kills It two hours of watching movie that doesn know what to do with itself It is the cinematic equivalent of walking in place The original Halloween II was similar but at least it found it footing in the last minutes and II also felt way more coherent as story than Kills does Kills just feels like hours of nothing with series of nonsensical random things happening and characters rattling off philosophical gibberish Halloween Ends was major improvement liked it quite bit except for the ending thought simply killing off Corey in massively anticlimactic way and making it just another Laurie vs Michael fight was huge mistake Because it essentially renders his entire plot line pointless and since his plot line is the main focus of the film It makes the entire movie feel pointless by extension Which significantly hurts its rewatch value in my opinion But take that ending out the rest of film is honestly very strong Making the botched ending even more unfortunate ', 'If you remove Halloween Kills from existence and treat it as direct sequel to Halloween its not as bad but still mids ', 'Love the Halloween movies in general but thought Halloween Kills was garbage kept apologizing to my GF for bringing her along', 'The last Jurassic park movie Its the only one Ive ever walked out on close second was Halloween kills', 'They don necessarily say the title of the movie but in halloween kills EVIL DIES TONIGHT was so overused and just came off as forced The dialog really as whole bunch that movie was so bad ', 'Not the first film in the franchise but the recent run of Halloween movies The one was one of the best ones in the series IMO Halloween Kills had fun action moments and the rest sucked and Halloween Ends was garbage ', 'Halloween Kills Granted its slasher wasn expecting an award winner but fuck it was bad It bothered me so much couldn get to sleep later that night ', 'Halloween Kills It was the first movie ever walked up and left', 'Halloween Halloween Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends Carpenter wrecked face on these soundtracks ', 'Halloween Kills The characters in it are soooooo stupid e how the town acts in general and the decisions the individual characters make can sum up how felt because as soon as you see there a sequel you just know he getting out of that basement fire even though it made no sense for him to live through that also how did the fire department get there that quick ', 'For me would have to say Halloween Ends had hoped it would make up for how dismal Halloween Kills was but it ended up being worse Same can be said for Jurassic World Dominion ', 'Halloween Kills Worst movie from the most uneven franchise ever ', 'Halloween kills was so fucking terrible couldnt believe how bad that movie was Never got around to ends becuase of this', 'most people dont like halloween kills but really enjoyed it but one thing for certain is that scene in the hospital that results in the death of that short fat bald guy is one of the worst pieces of cinema ever recorded Then there is the entirety of halloween ends ', 'Halloween Kills Imo the movie is fun and has nice kills but prepare to get shocked by how stupid and irrational people are One of the characters tries to take on goddamn Michael Myers with an Iron ', 'Halloween Kills Michael Myers was terrifying but every other character was as thick as thrice baked pigshit Its insane ', 'The closest was Halloween Kills That movie was burbling sack of diarhea', 'Halloween Kills had some issues but its Flashbacks were choice ', 'Similarly in Halloween Kills the whole movie is so laughably absurd it borders on parody that thought something would happen at the end So the entire previous film and in Kills they attempt to get Michael to speak over and over At the end of Kills when Michael slashes up Judy Greer before it cut to black legit thought Michael was going to finally speak and say Gotcha LMAO It would bee ridiculous but that truly the feeling got from how hilariously bad that second film was ', 'Halloween kills was simply fun time to see Michael kill people Wasn very well written but was very enjoyable', 'Halloween Kills was pretty awful but great slasher ', 'Thats funny The Last Duel is film thought would hate but ended up loving ', 'I loved The Last Duel One of my favorite Adam Driver performances To answer your question Id say Nekrotronic Stupid movie but damn it was good time ', 'I had the opposite reaction to The Last Duel Thought d love it hated it ', 'I really enjoyed The Last Duel Im not sure though why Ridley Scott was so surprised that it failed at the box office It was never going to be packed theatre go with your friends take your date movie just an incredibly filmed and acted period piece Also another showcase of the greatest American actor working today Adam Driver ', 'Surprising you said you loved the last duel for me love the middle ages and period piece films but HATE the liar he said she said thriller did or didn it happen aspect in story telling Like grind my ing gears had an idea of what the plot was in my head based on the trailers seen some reviews and even read up on the plot and was almost like correct so m still adamant would hate the movie because already guessed what the plot was And still won watch it lol Especially since Ridley Scott said how millenials or something ruined cinema for that movie ', 'Nah fuck the last duel it was the same damn thing over and over', 'I thought The Last Duel was awesome and come in super judgey when it comes to medieval films But honestly thought it would be pretty good Scott made an interesting change from the historical account of the crime itself making the Squire account and the Lady account very similar with subtle but important differences In the book and the trials the crime was much more violent and theres no room for thinking Entitled Asshole may have really thought he was inmicent ', 'The Last Duel is overrated Rashomon by Akira Kurosawa is better and leaves things way more ambiguous ', 'The Last Duel is my favourite film of the decade so far OP is right it absolutely did not deserve to bomb ', 'That so weird thought was going to love The Last Duel and found its pacing and structure really disjointed And still can get over Matt Damon mullet ', 'The Last Duel was surprisingly my favorite film of that year It bombing sucks but it getting no awards love is just plain weird ', 'The Last Duel as well d add Scott Pilgrim Thought it looked awful and loved it ', 'Needs to wash the stink of The Last Duel off ', 'Every comment seems to be making fun of the fact that there is no need for the sequel and it will ruin the legacy of the first Gladiator say we sit back and wait and see There is good chance this movie is well worth our time not disappointment and compliments the first one The Last Duel shouldnt have worked they way it was set up and with the cast but it was one of the best movies of So shut up ', 'In my opinion The Last Duel was ruined by Matt Damon being the only person with an American accent It felt so out of place ', 'Because The Last Duel did poorly at the box office even though it was great movie Americans only get hyped for known IPs and Brands We do it to ourselves ', 'In the mean time ll enjoy rewatching the last duel', 'The Last Duel and The Martian were both very good films ', 'The combat in the last duel was absolutely phenomenal best hand to hand medieval combat in film Really excited to see him

Matchstick Men and The Duelists are all considered good to great films', 'I thoroughly enjoyed The Last Duel', 'Honestly they ve all been pretty terrible since The Martian amp The Last Duel being the only decent ones', 'I also like the Last Duel But it bombed at the box office And thought he was clumsy with it Martian is fair while ago at this stage Mid Id say it would be certified classic but in recent times Id imagine Scott will blow it Hope he doesnt but hes lost the trust from me', 'The Last Duel was great definitely not an easy watch though ', 'Who cares if butts were in the seats The Last Duel is an awesome movie There aren butts in the seats for lot of amazing movies doesn make them less amazing ', 'The Martian was absent in my mind when made my comment Easily his best movie out of the last few years The Last Duel had incredible production just didnt care much for the story Definitely due rewatch ', 'The Last Duel was very good ', 'The Last Duel is fantastic The Martian was hit Napoleon might be interesting with Mr Phoenix ', 'The Last Duel is fantastic ', 'The Last Duel is great movie just bound to turn people away with the rape scene regardless hate those scenes but didn think it was anywhere near as terrible as some other movies and feel like it gave lot more weight to the story and the different accounts of it from each character Both Adam Driver and Matt Damon gave good performances thought Matt Damon would have been terrible in this but he surprised me ', 'The Martian was pretty widely acclaimed and is probably one of the best popcorn movies of the last decade Nothing groundbreaking but really solid and fun And loved The Last Duel Covid weird haircuts rape as subject matter killed it at the box office but its really good thoughtfully made film that managed to be relevant without turning bunch of medieval characters modern ', 'In still bitter over the Last Duel Loved that movie ', 'The Last Duel and The Handmaiden both rip off of Rashomon', 'The duel between Jacques Le Gris and Jean de Carro in The Last Duel Incredibly tense ', 'The final battle in The Last Duel that was pretty cool fight', 'You surely haven seen The Last Duel which was magnificent ', 'And like with that one their loss The Last duel did have more positive reviews though ', 'South of heaven What great unexpected ending ', 'I hope this is as good as SOUTH OF HEAVEN

way this wont be as bad or worse ', 'Muppets Haunted Mansion is really good in my opinion because it felt like good modern adaptation of the Muppets when Jim Henson was still around although it has flaws But of course nothing will ever beat Muppets Christmas Carol Literal perfect masterpiece that is an all time classic watch every year', 'Im fine with the new guys no one can do the job forever

movie is awesome ', 'I watched the new muppets haunted mansion movie that just came out with my little one while we were carving pumpkins It was fun time was little shocked because she had no idea who

Mansion Halloween special on Disney just this week and lot of people seem to like it ', 'Dave Chappelle The Closer liked it like older Dave Chappelle stuff better guess it goes with the times Comedy

between Tom Hardy and Symbiote But no the only motivation they had going for him is that he can eat as many people as he wants That a fuckin joke if you ask me They should have shown brutal fight

wall that wall is grey so it makes the colours off The sides didn exactly line up with the main screen and it was off putting It seems the movie is put thru program that stretches the sides in only specific scenes Not worth it at all Go premium screen and sound Dbox if you have that saw special Dbox activated preview of Top Gun before Dr Strange and that was great ', 'Which is wild because it

the movie Holy shit yeah its dumpster fire honestly believe the people who made this movie had no idea about what was going to happen in NWH or in the stinger for let there be carnage for that matter

pretty turned off by Rami Malek early method behavior which maybe they just had to lean into for the press tour to win Best Actor but thought he was ton of fun in both No Time To Die and Amaterdam

development on Daniel Craig version with new vulnerability and growth The Bond villain was perfectly deranged finally bringing the end of the world stakes to Craig tenure Felix appearance held weight and felt climactic Seydoux character was more than great Bond girl that actually mattered in Bond life The other girls were more badass than sexy Then the third act comes and everything falls apart was excited when they get to the base full on seige Everything building to this face off But it all sort of falls apart story wise and the chapter pacing just feels off The villain motive no longer makes sense just sort of selling to the highest bidder gag It would ve been better if he wanted to take over the world Would ve fit his sense of maniacal justice When everyone split up the characters wander in circles for bit as time runs out The villain disappears Another issue arises has to confess to the US Navy to authorize missile strike The sub plot regarding s intelligence mistake would ve come to head with communication over destroying the base They cut as he has to make that decision When we get back the missiles are being fired That sub plot finishes with no dramatic consequence The villain pops back up out of nowhere and Bond gets contaminated Missiles blow everything up The end All the soppy sacrifice shit just felt like dud All in all it better than Quantum and Spectre but it so weak compared to Casino Royale and Skyfall Would ve preferred Bond not to die as well It would ve provided bittersweet ending to Craig Bond He always quitting and returning in his films It would ve

they have distanced themselves from it have never seen better movie in my life that director and star want nothing or little to deal with', 'I recently saw Copshop and he was impressive in that You really get to see number of different sides from him ', 'Late in the day watched copshop not perfect but enjoyed it for what it is Malignant is batshit crazy enjoyable movie that love Wan just went all out with the big studio backing to make one for him ', 'He steals the show from bigger names in Copshop which probably isnt everyones cup of tea but love good Carnahan flick noir ', 'Copshop is the most covid movie ever liked it for what it is but you re right that it lacking ', 'Just watched Copshop on Peacock Frank Grillo and Gerard Butler Wasnt expecting much but it was actually surprisingly great Had some style to it and was pretty brutal ', 'Copshop was so good', 'I just recently watched Copshop amp Toby Huss was so good in it He completely blew Gerard Butler amp Frank Grillo off the screen His deranged hitman Anthony Lamb made great case for him as The Joker at some point ', 'Copshop was brilliant as well And he was the best part of The Purge franchise', 'Re watched the other night since it was released Very fun film Surprised it held up But having said that Joe Carnahan is very un celebrated filmmaker in my eyes think Boss Level is probably his weakest film but still had good time with it Absolutely loved Copshop though ', 'Yeah want more and more from Carnahan He makes the type of action movies that mostly seem missing from today films Copshop was great Boss Level was enjoyable ', 'He was also pretty good in Copshop Hes grown on me over the years ', 'Copshop thought was pretty good and basically one location shoot', 'Copshop Another little fun action romp from Joe Carnahan One fateful night conman Frank Grillo on the run from something finds himself booked in police station in small Nevada town drunk stranger Gerard Butler also finds himself in the same jail as the conman and it soon becomes apparent he has score to settle with the conman Teddy Frank Grill and Gerard Butler are in top form as they verbally spar and try to gain the upper hand on each other but it really Alexis Louder and Toby Huss show Newcomer Alexis Louder plays the hotshot cop entangled in this shitstorm and she is more than up to the task showing off her natural charisma and action chops Toby Huss livens up the film as the cooky and psychopathic hit man who gleefully chews up the scenery The entire film feels like throwback to the action films of the from the style soundtrack to the focus on the buildup to the chaos than on jamming action scenes and explosions just because Maybe it good that Joe Carnahan has gotten away from the mainstream Hollywood studios because then we would get more of these original old school action flicks like this ', 'This is one of my favorite genres Recent movie called CopShop is good too', 'Malignant and Copshop both had pretty cool title sequences', 'Dude you need to see Copshop ', 'Copshop Just good small scale action movie ', 'Yall need to watch copshop', 'Loved copshop ', 'I just watched Copshop the other day and he was pretty great in that', 'Alexis Louder acquitted herself very well as an action co lead in Copshop which highly recommend to fans of Shane Black Donner McTiernan style action

with my mama and the internet has bashed it Maybe it was less cringe in our language idk', 'Not only that but because it was about two princesses it became more famous and loved Imagine having Cinderella and Rapunzel in the same movie You get the point ', 'I think nostalgia really affects this one for me but Disneys Cinderella Cinderella as character feels so much more developed than Snow White and Aurora she feels like she could fit in with the Disney princesses Snow White is dated because of the animation story and Sleeping Beauty is dated because Aurora is kind of nothingburger of title character but Cinderella has strong plot and main character for an animated film of its time always forget that it was made in because of how well it holds up ', ' Cinderella III Twist in Time is fucking FANTASTIC movie and is unironically the best of the trilogy ', 'The Cinderella remake dont have nostalgia for the classic and so this completely took me by surprise of the only really solid remakes Disney made this and jungle book ', 'Best Cinderella movie in my opinion And best stepmother ', 'My my This is the definite Cinderella version It amazing and everyone should see it', 'It a literal fairy tale like Cinderella She the protagonist who begins the story with no prospects but demeaning menial servitude but big heart and destiny She even faces series of increasingly dangerous otherworldly foes and is saved by the animals she befriended along the way It just happens to be told with SF set dressing instead of fantasy set dressing ', 'I didn really like it to be honest like the idea the protagonist turning evil which is plot always find interesting and the references to other popular princess tropes were cool but it felt lot more disney channel original if that makes sense Overacting too dramatic which both make sense in disney princess parody but felt like it crossed the line from ironic all the way to cringy like how the amazon version of cinderella felt m not sure if anything wrote made sense ', 'I can see that but did enjoy the live action Cinderella remake', 'I liked the cinderella the most because they added more to the story In the original movie you only know about the stepmother and stepsisters and Cinderella is not treated well Showing that she had mother and father then having them died showed you how she got to that point in her life There is also different versions of Snow White and the little mermaid though most are not from Disney It is getting harder to find the original movies Even if they are streaming service they will be taken down at Some point To be honest hope that they will add to the story ', 'They ve mostly leaned towards bad instead of good actually really liked the Cinderella amp Jungle Book remakes and the Aladdin remake was okay Lion King is bad enough that it really funny The Beauty amp the Beast amp Mulan remakes were just cringeworthy and embarrassing and the Pinocchio remake is one of the worst films ve ever seen That being said m somewhat looking forward to the Little Mermaid remake ve never been huge on the original but really love the casting of Halle Bailey as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula The Snow White remake will not be good lol ', 'Im just going to assume you havent watched Cinderella III Twist In Time Its certainly leagues beyond the likes of Pocahontas Hunchback and Mulan though ', 'Funny am not actually that big in the animated Cinderella while love the animated Beauty and the Beast it is only second to Fantasia Meanwhile find the live action Cinderella to wonderful while the live action Beauty and the Beast is just meh at best ', 'While agree that what makes the film so good the Prince is an actual person can do that to the original The music and even the mice is what makes Cinderella such wonderful fairy tale ll be honest m biased as as the animated Cinderella is my favorite classic Disney film ', 'I will still die on the hill that Cinderella is great Not as good as the original but great adaptation ', 'The Card Counter held on for the whole movie because of the critics reviews and Oscar Isaac but wow what an absolutely terrible experience watching that movie

Collar First Reformed and The Card Counter', 'In The Card Counter she and Oscar Isaac had absolutely ZERO chemistry ', 'She is very distracting in the card counter Haven seen the rest ', 'This is what was looking for Gosh she was AWFUL in the card counter Truly one of the worst performances Ive seen', 'Yes That performance in The Card Counter was awful It looked like Oscar Isaac was going through his scenes fully in character while stand in from the local acting class was filling in ', 'Tiffany Haddish was horrible in The Card Counter It was hard to watch her scenes ', 'Tiffany Haddish was not conventionally good in The Card Counter but it such good movie that m willing to see it as sort of brechtian or ironic or experimental thing that benefits the work as whole ', 'The card counter was awful if only for the ludicrous card counting and betting ', 'She was TERRIBLE in the card counter interesting movie but she couldnt hang with Oscar ', 'I totally agree Her performance in The Card Counter was so bizarre and awful wonder if she was last second replacement There was zero onscreen chemistry between her and Isaac have had less than favorable opinion of her ever since she and Andy Serkis were announcing one year Oscar nominations and though he did great job on his part pronouncing all the nominees names Haddish clearly didn spend any time practicing them beforehand as she kept fumbling and screwing up the pronunciations to point where Serkis even had to help her year or so later when the discussion came up about who should host the Academy Awards her name would come up and m pretty sure those who mentioned her never saw the nomination program because it was an awkward mess ', 'Tiffany Haddish just can not take her seriously in dramatic role recently watched The Card Counter with my husband and whenever she came on we would honestly just start chuckling ', 'Tiffany Haddish in The Card Counter wanted to like her and it wasnt comically bad just super wooden ', 'I agree she isn a very good dramatic actor and think she generally only good when allowed free reign to do her schtick like in GIRLS TRIP or weirdly the Tyler Perry movie NOBODY FOOL However actually think she good in the Card Counter It a tough role as think she was specifically cast because she brings completely different energy from the rest of the movie so she by design incongruous Plus that Paul Schrader dialogue can be little odd ', 'I think this is the winner seriously thought Tiffany Haddish was going to rock it in serious roles Her performance in The Card Counter is so wooden and fake spent the whole movie assuming it was intentional that she was going to double cross Oscar Isaac It was just too perfect He needs someone to stake him for the tourney AND he lonely Then she shows up with cash and love Then it turns out she was sincere the whole time Kinda killed the movie for me ', 'Ikr felt the same had no idea people didn like her in The Card Counter', 'Can you bring me up to speed here Has she done something awful FWIW thought she was pretty good in The Card Counter ', 'Tiffany Haddish in The Card Counter seemed lost', 'Tiffany Haddish She is so wooden as dramatic actor See The Card Counter On the Count of Three and Here Today actually dont see that last one ', 'The card counter Was decent movie', 'Now check the Card Counter for another take on the same character and Taxi Driver if you haven already Love this film ', 'I watched this because HBO Max recommended it to me after finished Rock Rolla Those are two very different movies First it was terrible Weird story jumps No chemistry between characters No believability in character motivations Just bunch of stuff that happens with lot of Tell and not show What was compelling to me however was this is COVID movie The movies filmed in will always be interesting to me they look different The sets feel smaller The background actors are fewer and they keep weird distance from each other The scale feels more TV and stage than movie You can feel the production working under constraints and it shows in every single scene To that end The Card Counter was interesting On its own merits it was pretty terrible ', 'If this is anything like The Card Counter Ill be passing The Card Counter was legitimately the first movie in over decade where seriously contemplated walking out of the theater many times while watching it Such an awful film ', 'You are getting downvoted but totally agree thought the Card Counter was legitimately one of the worst serious movies Ive ever seen In my opinion its the perfect movie for people who like to think theyre smart because they watch movie thats dark The dialogue was atrocious it felt so forced and unnatural and it seemed like every dialogue scene was just people sitting and drinking the characterizations were non existent other than oooh have dark and mysterious past The symbolism was so on the nose it hurt do you get it he cant beat the guy who chants USA The acting was very subpar Oscar Isaac was one note and honestly little boring And he had literally zero chemistry with Tiffany Haddish ', 'The Card Counter was incredibly boring but do like Joel and Sigourney ', 'I didn like it as much as First Reformed But the pay off in The Card Counter is great you should definitely give it another shot if you ever get the feeling ', 'The Card Counter was the most boring movie ve seen and my first Schrader movie ', 'While didn love The Card Counter as whole thought it was an incredible character study featuring one of Oscar Isaac best performances to date so m looking forward to this ', 'I wouldn be calling out the card counter for credibility that movie was hot garbage ', 'Id also argue that The Card Counter does have interesting ideas ', 'The Card Counter like Oscars performance obviously but all together was mediocre affair wanted to like Tiffany Haddish so bad but her performance was undeniably wooden Big Schrader fan First Reformed Is one of my favorite movies in recent memory But in his growing catalog of movies about grim men dealing with the weight of the world this ones just fine ', 'The Card Counter It blew me away and wasn sure what to expect at all aside from always loving Oscar Isaac If you haven seen it think Drive but more trippy and slightly less violent m so impressed with the quality of films being put out in the past couple years don think it recency bias to say that some of them are already among my favorite movies Spencer Pig Mitchell Vs The Machines Nine Days The Card Counter Suicide Squad Everything Everywhere All At Once Top Gun Maverick and more The level of vision and technology are combining in awesome ways that make life worth living ', 'Probably his last truly great film Hope he can get there again but The Card Counter was massive letdown And say this as huge Schrader fan ', 'The Card Counter Wtf was that So all over the place horrible casting Tiffany Haddish All conversations were wooden af Gave me First Reformed vibes which also had no pay off Same director figures ', 'I in the middle of watching The Card Counter and this comment made me feel validated m not alone this movie made other people suffer just like me Thank you ', 'The Card counterwalked out of the theater', 'Btw sorry the movie itself is just called Ghost in the Shell but the Puppet Master is the AI character that becomes sentient Zone is not great movie or anything very derivative of Blade Runner but the character of Jane and her sentient personality as robot prostitute in walled city full of other robots is crux of the film Wall is of course about trash compacting robot that gains personality and falls in love and Her is also about AI love as well Chappie is about law enforcement robot kidnapped by gangsters so you get to see how his personality changes over the course of the movie as he is essentially child that is being raised by them ', 'I really am not fan of this Netflix true crime documentary style that has fake footage of the subject Same thing with Misha and the Wolves on Netflix They take an incredibly interesting topic and then it bland ass fake footage for minutes At this point d rather it be true crime podcast', 'I personally thought Misha and the Wolves was really interesting story but not very well put together as documentary didnt like the actor

see Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings without seeing as much as poster before We wanted to go to the cinema this sounded like sort of fantasy movie so we picked it haven had that much fun watching the movie in years Later saw that even poster contains spoilers Since then either not watch the trailers at all or always turn them off at max minute length It much more fun when you have no idea what to expect from the movie ', 'Michelle Yeoh is great actress even though she almost now still being activity in action movies was impressed with the movie called Shang chi and the Legend of

Honestly if you want to look for similar fight scenes just look for some of the best martial artists that are actors and search their fight scenes up on YouTube and find the movies Some of the best

Shang Chi is fighting his dad but then we have to pause for while to watch Katy be awesome with bow or whatever And the Dweller in Darkness was kind of last minute heres the REAL bad guy now care about it type of deal sort of like Black Widow dont know if this is faithful to the comics or anything and guess Id have to give it rewatch to really critique it but overall look forward to seeing more of the characters Just feel like they tried to make too many epic things happen too quickly at the very end Not everything has to wrap up with LoTR battle you know ', 'Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings Some of the action scenes and CGI straight up looked cartoonish was shocked how bad few parts were just saw it so it fresh on my mind Wonder Woman seriously don understand how good WW

polarizing and we assumed he would love it instead of me Total opposite ', 'I genuinely enjoyed malignant but can absolutely understand why people hate it It seemed like it was advertised as somewhat normal but creepy body horror movie to me it read like an action comedy on horror foundation It was so over the top and insane that cant imagine it was supposed to be taken seriously Also the action scene choreography is insane and many of Gabriel lime made me genuinely laugh out loud categorize in my head with the likes of cabin in the woods the menu Mandy etc over the top almost satirical

but little more nuanced ', 'Malignant thought it was amazing', 'Malignant starts out like horror movie but then pulls and becomes like action thriller at the end thought it was awesome lol',

the bad guy are just subjects to it Vessels channels and outlets That what makes it so good ', 'I honestly loved Malignant Its tough to make really fun horror movie think its the best in that movie

Malignant know it has quite mixed reviews but found it so much fun ', 'Its not fun dont let people try and convince you it is If you want fun horror check out Malignant or Terrifier ', 'Malignant had the best chair throw on movie ever Also great movie that goes soooo far off the fucking rails in its last third while still being entertaining ', 'I still have no idea if Malignant was an incredibly stupid horror movie or comedic satire of horror movies', 'I think if Malignant theatrical run hadn been ruined by COVID it would have made waves ', 'Yeah agree Like malignant for example was just bat

ridiculous The new Resident Evil was fun ride not super scary though ', 'That wild that you got that from the trailer It looks brilliantly campy in the trailer will never miss James Wan movie after

James Wan which imo makes the movie much more genius ', 'Malignant had trailer that made me so excited to see the movie It ended up shocking me but not in good way That movie was laughably awful but not even in the way where theyre in on the joke Just stupid This one was definitely better than that one but just missing the three or four trailer highlight scenes that made me want to watch Malignant', 'Thanks for the explanation This makes lot of sense and loved Malignant so ll probably check this out The trailer gave me unintentionally bad pop horror written for teens vibes like Bye Bye Man or La Llorona Good to know that not the case ', 'I enjoyed this more than but agree that Malignant is far far far better than this movie', 'Really Malignant gets way more insane than this',

set and somehow convinced people they were amazing It was terrible in so many ways The dialogue your voice How did you manage to reclaim it unintelligible actors the only way could tell if some of them were speaking English or Japanese was because the Japanese dialogue was subtitled characters with no arc or motivations Psycho The samurai dude who randomly killed everybody scenes that had zero consequences the bicycle the girl mowing people down with the gatling gun no payoff ratman repairs all the cars to get people out of there nobody uses the cars bad props plastic ridfles the electronics on Cages suit looked like terrible cosplay props and zero worldbuilding what about this radiation How did the governor get to be in charge of this western town Why is that clock structure

else was just having great time ', 'Yes m big fan of Cena in Wwe and not gonna lie watched lots of his early movies just because he was in it But he really caught me off guard with his recent projects His comedic timing was astounding in Vacation Friends And Peacemaker holly cow It just become mine favorite series of all time ', 'Ha remember outraged parents storming out of Candyman with their kids', 'A great argument could be made that Candyman is the greatest horror film ever made It certainly one of my very favorites and one of the very few that still give me the chills when watch it all these years later Largely due to Tony Todd performance ', 'I need to rewatch Candyman Tony Todd is one of my favorites as far as Trek guest actors and need to go into Candyman with the proper amount of attention on his performance', 'Tony Todd in Candyman For anyone who doesn know his background he a big theater guy stage actor He absolutely goes above and beyond and elevates the film and material to whole different level in my opinion There an eerie understated and tragic love story at the core apparently cut down by the studio that found the interracial nature of it too controversial and he plays the fuck out of it Also think Candyman is great film despite the changes etc but think without Tony Todd it could ve absolutely been just another slasher ', 'Yup Candyman was that way for me except it was literal years before could go into dark bathroom ', 'Considering how self aware that series was early on with the Stab movies feel like it becoming extremely overdone One of the few real modern takes on the old school slasher that kind of liked was Candyman m kinda also looking forward to the Evil Dead spinoff movie too Who knows this may be fun but there only so many twist murderers you can keep doing before it just not fun anymore This one ll be the brother cousin step father uncles college roommate who secretly had cruch on Syd and is taking it out on the new last girl probably ', 'I would say two recent horror movies Candyman which is sequel reboot and Hellraiser which suppose is reboot but there no reason it couldn take place in the same universe as the original and class as sequel Anyway two really tightly made and interesting movies that certainly didn expect would be made ', 'Original Candyman Fucked me up as kid', 'This definitely happened in Candyman It seemed like there were too many ideas started that they did not have time to flesh out and not nearly enough character development for me to care about them Runtime isnt the only issue to blame for this but it definitely affected everything you listed ', 'The original Candyman HANDS DOWN ', 'Candyman was terrible too So much wasted potential ', 'Candyman walked out it was so stupid', 'Candyman loved the original but this one was disappointing More humorous than scary ll never watch it again ', 'The voyeurs Looks like pretty standard movie where the main characters look out the window and see something suspicious For the most part it pretty standard but the twist at the end is batshit crazy ', 'Did you see The Voyeurs was actually entertained throughout that movie', ' The voyeurs is newish sexual thriller it kinda silly but enjoyed it ', 'I watched the Voyeurs the other day and it was just shitty twist after shitty twist', 'In The Voyeurs during the spa scene it just popped in my head like what if they re fucking with her quickly forgot and got pulled back into the story but when the twist came at the end was amazed was partially right The full story was sooooo much worse than could have thought of That why disregarded it at first like no way anyone could pull that off great movie ', 'The Voyeurs and Nocturne were both pretty insane Watched them back to back because they both star Sydney Sweeney and enjoyed them ', 'The Voyeurs swiped pass this movie hundreds of times but yesterday morning was looking for breakfast movie and decided to play it thought it was awesome and surprising twist', 'The Woman in the Window was actually the worse of the two Rear Window genre films watched last year Amazon produced an erotic thriller called The Voyeurs starring Sydney Sweeney that was actually pretty good for the first before becoming completely stupid ', 'Came here to say this The Voyeurs is great erotic thriller One of the best have ever seen and judging by the reviews it didn connect with audiences precisely because of that Many complaining about the gratuitous sex scenes ', 'I very much would like return of the Erotic Thriller to the mainstream had blast with Amazon Prime The Voyeurs and think there is room for films of that ilk ', 'Oh loved the Voyeurs and it totally reminded me of late erotic thrillers', 'this is late but just watched this movie if the voyeurs was vhs tape d burn it pippa was terrible person', 'The Voyeurs was truly atrocious suppose if you can get Sydney Sweeney in your movie you can get literally anything made ', 'Examples of good modern erotic thrillers There was one called The Voyeurs this year ', 'The Woman in the Window Prime Video also just released The Voyeurs which is basically erotic thriller version of Rear Window Both movies were basically dogshit though', 'The Voyeurs the acting is so wooden it almost parody', 'The voyeurs new Amazon movie pretty good ', 'Not technically interrogations but the interviews with Ted Bundy in No Man of God are absolutely riveting ', 'I wanted No Man of God to be better than it was to be honest It was pretty good don get me wrong but it didn really get to me the way d hoped ', 'I recently watched No Man Of God which is entirely dialogue driven and basically Play Though love Elijah Wood as Producer and as champion of smaller interesting movies he completely lacks the gravitas for that role in my opinion Had they cast someone like Casey Affleck that could have been stacked with great memorable scenes ', 'Just saw No man of god Great cast the acting was spot on ', 'Enemies to lovers has become waaay overdone imo watched the Protg last month and cringed hard at year old Michael Keaton spending half of the movie trying to seduce years younger Maggie and she ends up in bed with him The whole sexual tension leading up to this felt so forced ', 'You are the first fan of Cpt Marvel have run into But agree The Protg was pretty good ', 'Just saw him in The Protege liked his characterization in that film Typical gun bunny flick but he crushed it ', 'Not OP but honestly adored the protege killer aspect with Corey Its something that is always kind of on the table with horror the possibility of an eventual passing of the torch by legendary slasher and quite liked the execution of the idea think the biggest flaws with the movie arent in its ideas but the fact that it all felt little too rushed If Corey had been introduced in Halloween Kills instead maybe Michael lets him go mid killing spree hinting at what was to come in the next film then think more people might be able to see that there was genuine attempt at something new had to suspend my disbelief tad when it came to how quickly Allyson fell for Corey but other than that was just pleased by new ideas in such well travelled genre', 'Myers was terrifying because he seemed human yet was supernaturally strong and resilient This movie kneecapped him passing of the torch was such weak choice and then to have the protege feed Myers yet have him get bodied by yogurt grandma is absolutely ridiculous His final death left me feeling empty Corey had potential but just fell absolutely flat and the copycat would have only psuedo worked if Lindsay joined in too Im going to assume David ended on this shit note on purpose cannot understand how director flops so hard ', 'I just recently watched this action movie called The Protege Maggie has mr and mrs smith fight sex scene withMichael Keatonit was so awkward', 'The Protege wasnt that bad Maybe it not his fault Maybe producers in Hollywood just dont understand why his films like Goldeneye and Edge of Darkness were so impactful think you shouldnt blame Martin for everything ', 'Hey now saw The Protege and had real good time with it completely forgettable action movies are great ', 'The Protege The beginning feels like John Wick movie but then the twists just make no fucking sense ', 'The protege and the foreigner kicked arse ', 'After GL The Foreigner was great movie His latest movie The Protege was good enough mean there was nothing new about it but liked the way it played out am looking forward for his Memory ', 'Idk The Protege was decisively average Interested if Memory is better', 'The Protg was actually pretty good', 'Martin Campbell is legit great action director He stages scenes very well and the action is always coherent and clever watched The Protege the other day just to throw something on in the background and ended up engrossed Campbell with one massive green exception typically exceeds expectations', 'The Protege Ignore the poor rating this movie has on IMDb this is pretty much the best action movie of this year brilliant cast great action scenes the story isnt that original but it has enough suspense to keep things interesting If you like action thriller movies give this one watch would say Dune is the best movie watched this year but its been mentioned already ', 'Check out The Protege with Maggie Samuel Jackson and Michael Keaton It great and definitely feels like the kind of mid budget thriller we all love ', 'Kate Ava Anna The Protege Gunpowder Milkshake All female led John Wick Nobody wannabes with actresses who suck at action directors who don know what they re doing and low budgets Doomed to fail projects ', 'Skip Gunpowder Milkshake and see The Protege instead ', 'Kate is infinitely better than Gunpowder Milkshake How they managed to make even Michelle Yeoh dull is beyond me The Protege was also much better ', 'I wish hit more on this point in my comment but yeah the race and gender of character shouldnt matter unless it needs to and doing an All Female reboot without reason for them to have to be all women was dumb Same with the Oceans reboot and others along those lines For instance ve been pretty excited to watch The Protege cause the trailer looks like another John Wick movie which love However they weren ever like look its john wick as lady It just another assassin movie with lead who happens to be female ', 'What was wrong with The Protege It wasn groundbreaking or anything but it was fun watch and Maggie is always excellent ', 'kate and the protege is better than this garbage', 'It looks like mixed reviews at best for Reminiscence which is unfortunate because the premise looked interesting The Protege looks like it could be fun action film but don think anyone is expecting spectacular here ', 'Sweet Girl starring Jason Mamoa was already really bad before it got to the final act twist Almost as bad as High Tension ', 'When saw her in Red Notice started to think she was horrible actress Death on the Nile confirmed my suspicions Shes great as Wonder Woman but thats it Same with Jason Momoa hes great as Aquaman and James Wan puts him in situations that play to his strengths with little dialogue but when watched Sweet Girl realized he cant act Hes great at action roles where hes angry and doing lot of fighting with very few lines or is supporting character g Dune but he has no range like Gadot ', 'Sweet Girl with that guy who plays Aquaman was very good one ', 'Sweet Girl Pretty bad movie but the plot twist was clever ', 'Yeah m cool with some highly trained assassin chick beating people up but when they re just random nobodies it pretty dumb even if they had some level of boxing mma training The worst ve seen recently was Netflix film called Sweet Girl It was so dumb especially because the people she beat up were some of the most deadly people in the country and all she had was some boxing training', 'I mean sweet girl on netflix had good twist about the girl being the hero but it probs not appropriate for kids that age ', 'Major blockbusters can make profit on streaming Let trash like He All That Sweet Girl and whatever Adam Sandler dreck go straight to streaming ', 'Yeah think the most recent one was the Netflix film Sweet Girl just found it utterly bland Life too short

', 'Sweet Girl on Netflix was truly awful movie but cannot help thinking if Beckett had cast Jason Momoa in the lead role Netflix would have ended up with one decent movie ', 'Recently watch Sweet Girl first minutes hits you HARD ', 'Nah just watched Momoa new Netflix movie too sweet girl Little girl Something like that and it wasn that it was awful it that it was crushingly dull and Jason Momoa had absolutely zero charisma at the heart of it the extent of his acting was being muscly and looking grumpy and just zero emotional depth or Anything just really don think he got the ability to be leading man Bautista is lot better but still arguably better as part of an ensemble or in supporting role ', 'Sweet Girl was so bad', 'It was flat out awful Worse than sweet girl ', 'Cool plot twist on sweet girl', 'I didnt think this movie was terrible if you want terrible go watch the new Jason Mamoa Netflix movie Sweet Girl but it was really predictable and derivative Even with wide non pandemic non same day streaming release it wouldnt have been box office smash Blaming box office returns on the age of the intended audience is completely ridiculous especially when you have historical fiction movies like Dunkirk and making half billion dollars pretty regularly If your movie is aimed at ANY audience and its actually GOOD its going to make money because quality is what leads to crossover appeal ', 'The twist in Sweet Girl had the opposite effect than intended for me Mostly because the actress was miscast and couldn convince my brain that she could do all those things that she supposedly did before or after the twist ', 'Turned off Christmas Prince The Royal Wedding about mins in think gave it more than it deserved ', 'This movie is called The Royal Wedding

great The music was good too Also the stop motion Pinocchio by Guillermo del Toro an animated masterpiece ', 'I have yet to watch Bryan Tyree Henry in something and not like him Heck even as bird in Vivo he steals the show ', 'Vivo was hot garbage My kids couldn follow it because every time there was musical number it switched to some sort of MTV Music Video fever dream Also you can try to love the soundtrack as long as you re ok with every song being about literally getting a monkey from Cuba to Miami with little subtext', 'Ive got kids of similar ages and and they love both We have family movie night where every Friday after work school we sit down and watch movie together Usually its new movie or at least one they havent seen in long time Mitchell Vs The Machines Vivo The Sea Beast

that list Its ridiculously good But enjoyed them all along with the kids which is what the night is about ', 'Fuck Vivo wanted to strangle the child characters in that film and have pretty high tolerance for annoying characters ', 'I could not get into Vivo The opening scene just kills it for me ', 'Vivo too No one remembers Vivo ', 'You have to mention also VIVO thats really beautiful movie

So guess quality does matter ', 'I prefer Vivo to Encanto think it has better narrative arc and is more focused Encanto is great but narratively its kind of mess think they make up for that with great songs and visuals But theres more meat on Vivo ', 'Aw liked Vivo', 'I had the same thought like this is Pixar version of that girl in Vivo As soon as she turned into panda and the story started got hooked and ended up loving it think the initial blah blah blah about being yourself and stuff at the start was setup to show someone just spewing words that sound good but haven yet lived enough to authentically understand them Mei had it easy as kid because her natural self was so compatible with her environment when panda comes out and she starts changing she has to learn to live those words with new natural self that doesn fit so easily ', 'Aaah this makes lot of sense honestly didn even realize Vivo wasn Disney but alas tale as old as time remember when WB movies were less celebrated

attention when the movie Vivo also has the musical stylings of Lin Manuel Miranda and was much better movie ', 'Vivo was dope Lin manuel miranda really puts together an entertaining movie and

hears it ', 'Don forget Vivo ', 'The Vivo soundtrack slaps IMO People like different things And that ok ', 'I didn like the songs for Vivo as much They have LMM lyrical cadence too much in them

why ', 'I feel like something is wrong with me after reading most of these comments didn like the music in Encanto very much at all enjoyed the movie overall but the music was for sure the least enjoyable part of it for me Loved LMM music in Moana and to lesser degree Vivo but just didn like any of the tunes in Encanto Oh well different strokes for different folks guess ', 'I a nanny and feel this way about the songs in Vivo The two year old has wanted to listen to those songs every day for months Sometimes pick some different music just for my own sanity usually from kid movie so she ll like it too and tell her we can listen to Vivo again later ', 'Good flick but preferred Vivo which really wasnt expecting ', 'Flee will probably come to my indie theater around Oscar time but m glad

would highly recommend everyone to watch it Before Bjorn visited Japan he used to receive thousands of fan mail letters from Japanese fans Then when he visited there it was like Beatlemania everywhere he went there were mass crowds trying to touch him or with scissors trying to clip lock of his hair huge signs everywhere saying Welcome to Japan Bjorn believe the film success and influence in Japan is somewhat understated in the West His popularity as result of the film was capitalised in many ways in Japan such as advertising and indeed successful pop singing career He sang in Japanese language completely unknown to him found this very impressive There was an Manga artist Ryoka Ikeda think she authored The Rose of Versailles She said the character beautiful female dressing and acting as man was directly influenced by Bjorn Andresen She also spoke of how there was change in manga circles around that time due to the film and how much of an influence Bjorn was on manga and anime of today

to save his daughter but it a much quieter film in reality more thoughtful and thought provoking ', 'I really liked Stillwater if recall its reception was pretty lukewarm ', 'Kind of sucks seeing movie about an area you re familiar with only to realize it wasn filmed there at all went to oklahoma state saw the god awful Stillwater movie thinking it be filmed in Stillwater Ok where campus is

pretty much sucked in my opinion If you like boring and depressing its good choice ', 'Stillwater is good ', 'I love what Stillwater did They took real life story and wrote an original screenplay highly inspired off of that story That way there were interesting elements from real life but ultimately there was no harm in taking whatever creative liberties they wanted ', 'I watched several of the interviews he did for Stillwater and my opinion of him skyrocketed Not that had bad opinion of him just never thought about him much before then He talked about how different he was compared to the people he was portraying in that movie but everyone had blast and got along ', 'His best performane since Ripley was probably in Stillwater you kind of forgot it was Damon playing the role ', 'I think he deserves best actor nomination for Stillwater this year He actually top of my list for films ve seen ', 'Agreed only thing it really fleshed out was that the rest of Stillwater werent that talented But yes way too slow and it is one of my favorite movies', 'Agreed thought Stillwater was great definitely not his typical mega budget flick ', 'I heard that in Stillwater he was really great too', 'His wife Alicia Vikander should be in more movies too Incredibly talented Other than The Green Knight she hasnt done much in the last few years Her last big projects were average action flicks

of cheesy movie leave the theater really satisfied then go online and everyone hates it like Van Helsing or League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Like just assumed it mustve been poorly reviewed because found it funny Lol ', 'Jungle Cruise was awesome tho But m assuming you didn mean it as compliment because haven seen Black Adam yet ', 'Yeah Peacemaker is fucking awesome The only downside is that do think you need to have seen The Suicide Squad to fully understand Peacemaker character arc ', 'I mean anything with Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn seems to fit your requirements perfectly especially Birds of Prey She a super villain but she usually the protagonist and not the movie big bad The Suicide Squad is the best movie she in although that mostly due to the director awesome cast Birds of Prey is really her movie and shows her somewhat growing as character while still being badass ', 'I ve only just started marathon of these and Out of Death is my favorite so far Out of Death features rapidly deteriorating performance by Willis that begins competently declines into drunkenness and concludes in mindless line recitation with help from an obvious earpiece Cosmic Sin on the other hand was so bad couldn even get laugh from it It is talky cheap looking and confusing And Willis barely has any lines meaning he doesn get to display that awesome range of bad enjoyed so much with Out of Death That two down can wait to see the other six ', 'Totally agree with you love Bruce Willis but his recent work has been more than ordinary started watching this movie called Out of death and it just proved your point There are currently movies either in production or just completed listed on IMDB that he is involved in ', 'Gray Man was better than Gunpowder Milkshake and Project Power Gray Man was just very average Those other films were straight up bad ', 'It came around the same time as Kate and Jolt and somehow got better score than both of those female lead action movies had so much more fun watching Jolt than Gunpowder Milkshake ', 'Gunpowder Milkshake It had great cast cool concept and some good action Unfortunately it ended up being generic and the world and characters were poorly developed If they had fleshed it out more and given it an identity outside of being Tarantino John Wick clone it could have been awesome ', 'Nostalgia bait isnt bad When its done well Ghostbusters After Life was great Back in Action wasnt bad Space Jam New Legacy was dogshit Hell Sonic was really fun Its ok to have fun movies ', 'I may be minority but really enjoyed Space Jam New Legacy really love that sort of live action cartoon hybrids It is very dumb movie but dumb at funny cartoony way The father son relationship that was there to give the story some depths or an excuse to be full film was lame but all the fun with the Looney Tunes is worth it Pure entertainment no more no less ', 'I really liked it when was kid but every time have rewatched it over the years am always like meh still prefer it over the travesty that is Space Jam New Legacy ', 'Space Jam New Legacy somehow makes the already mediocre original movie look like Lawrence of Arabia would also say Infinite but slept through of that thing so it would be little unfair', 'Im all for generic action movies but he doesnt have leading action man gravitas Like compare Chris Pratt in the tomorrow war to Michael Jordan in without remorse Same kind of meh movie but MBJ allows you to take it somewhat seriously Chris Pratt is only good when theres comedy involved', 'This also loosely inspired the Tomorrow War which is an awesome movie ', 'I liked the movie and the idea was awesome The action scenes were awesome It had lot of terrifying aspects to it which enjoyed think other people who like sci fi and action movies will like The Tomorrow War ', 'The Purge movies have always been big guilty pleasure movie series for me but honestly had lot less fun with this one than the past few movies The beginning was boring and the fake out jump scares in the first hour really got stale Kinda wish they fully embraced the road trip during purge concept or fully embraced the forever purge being lefty thing Either of those would ve made this entry lot more memorable to me but it seems they can help but fall back on the same cultural themes messages they always do Not terrible movie but it followed the beats of the previous movies way too much for it to still be interesting to me It just feels stale That said thought the characters in this one felt more real than in prior Purge films really enjoyed the Tucker story m glad they didn go the obvious route of having Dylan his father being big evil racists Adela was awesome too If remember anything about this entry it ll be the characters not the action or the horror or plot ', 'My full thoughts on the movie The Purgefranchise has never been one to waffle around in what some might call subtlety and this movie might be the most blunt and heavy handed of all of them The preceding movies put more and more focus on the social themes the series was trying to convey until my pick for best in the franchiseThe First Purgeopenly states that the Purge is used by government officials as means of class and ethnic control The Forever Purgeimagines what happens when that kind of idealogue escapes its way into the general population Focusing on two Mexican immigrants the story quickly pushes into their first Purge night as Americans settling an awful lot of time on convoy of armored trucks driving around and purging all of the non Americans they come across hint non whites that certainly isn ham fisted foreshadowing The Purge ends in the morning and they all return back to their lives Or do they Quickly it is revealed that the Purge is in fact not over and perhaps it never will be as the Purgers reveal they don plan to ever stop purging One of the purgers who properly kick starts the movie reveals that he doing it out of some nihilistic leftist view of destroying exploitation and wage slavery displaying that all of the people senselessly butchering others in the streets aren all an implausibly large group of white supremacists able to defeat the military rolling in to establish order The real root cause is the rage that American society breeds and the fetishization of violence that comes with it One of the subtleties the movie does get across quite well Most Americans have very vague and nebulous political beliefs Murder and anger are the true beliefs prevalent in America On technical level this movie does impress more than lot ofPurgemovies There an impressive long take featuring tank that is engaging The characters are little more fleshed out than otherPurgemovies including fairly obvious but still satisfying redemption arc Sometimes the movie falls back into the series worst elements an incredibly cringe inducing monologue by Nazi with swastika on his cheek cool one liner near the end that made me groan but still it never dipped too low where it pulled me out of what was going on This movie has lot to say even if lot of it is surface level and obvious but will give it props for actually having something meaningful and heavy to say especially for Hollywood franchise Brutally nihilistic incredibly gory and very in your face The Forever Purgecaptures good amount of what lot of people feel about the future of America while also being decent action horror movie to boot ', 'I just want to see them do something even remotely interesting with the whole Purge premise This new movie The Forever Purge just looks mind numbingly stupid to me ', 's of the show really sets up the premise for the forever purge so highly recommend for anyone who seems bit confused by the jump in narrative topic isn necessary as they take the anthology approach', 'The deep house haunted house movie but the house is underwater made me hold my breath few times just because of that Dead silence haunted dolls movie still creepy', 'Two come to mind The Mist ending where he shoots everybody in the head including his own young child and then runs out of bullets plans to step outside to let the monsters kill him and then the army shows up to save the day mean it not like that movie was super fantastic but dunno That ending The other is the Deep House That concept was fucking amazing haunted house underwater Never really seen that and having the dead bodies slowly walking around down the stairs etc all while protagonists are running out of oxygen with no way out Loved it Then it ended with that stupid horror trope jooooiiiin uuuuusss Ugh was pissed ', 'i think its called The Deep House had to remind myself to breathe because myself felt like was running

an actor have noticed that the overwhelming majority of things see casting calls for now skew LGBTQ or ethnically based Which is great but another caveat is now the majority of calls are looking for people who are legitimately what the brief is looking for Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of acting So ya from what see both on screen and in the call sheets it is def trending towards LGBTQ Which to pick up on the point above don feal there doing good job off even Recent example and know it a kids flick the main love story in fear street was horrific If the lead lady was Lead guy her actions would be considered highly disturbing So it pity to get representation and for that representation to be shit ', 'It was better than No Remorse for sure not like that a high bar It was pretty

are unaware of They find the headless body dad shows up blah blah your standard fare movie stuff Fast forward the cop is taking Dror again cop gets call to make sure he gets daughter This is pivotal scene We see Dror take plastic bag which believe has the head in it throw it away across the street then help and old lady back We are distracted from this because the cop makes comment about who helps old ladies still But before we can process what we saw now we are introduced to the father of the murdered girl trailing both the cop and Dror We see dad motives blah blah day forward to Dror missing his girls wanting to give birthday present This distracts us completely to the fact that the girl he makes the cake for is not his daughter it the cops daughter And it not birthday cake it a rape cake Up to and including all the torture not once does Dror falter not the viewer suspect him guilty thought it was the father all along and he was just twisted But once he left to dig up head knew it couldn be him Then we find cops daughter is missing can be Dror he been in basement You never think back to the birthday cake scene because it was set up to appear like it was his daughter

birthday because she wasn invited to party Cruella wanted to murder puppies to make fur coat It perfectly fine to just write them off as horrible people We don need backstory to redeem them They are

action remake is dalmations The reason it worked was that it updated it and took it in way that was different yet still captured the charm The others have tried to stay too true to the original and not update or do new angle Cinderella compared to maleficent is great example of this While Cinderella was very close to the original and was frankly meh Maleficent was an interesting twist while still containing was what great about the characters Cruella did the same but much like Dalmatians is often overlooked Once upon time was great series that gained lot of audiences at the start by doing the same They then did the whole season frozen thing that was not the normal twist and saw audiences complain because it was too close They wanted to see an evil elsa or at least twist in some way If you look too at what are being remade it is those titles that can been shown to kids due to the originals not aging well This is so kids get to know their older characters Aladdin jungle book mulan and Dumbo all have warnings now due to shift in what is seen as acceptable or straight up don appear in the kids sections Peter pan has real issue type of remake with this and it is just not possible to do in such way that they used Tinkerbell and Jake and the Neverland pirates series instead That what they need to do in other ways but nostalgia in parents too comes into the equation Dalmatian street and the new takes on Mickey and co is proving popular but it not as far reaching due to the paywall that is having disney plus or cable sky virgin so don make any where as much money

Dragon Cruella and Cinderella were all good IMO No idea why they get hate ', 'I really liked the angle they took with Maleficent and Cruella Rather than re making Sleeping Beautity they gave us the story from Maleficent POV know some people take umbridge with how they made her not as evil but it was very well done and interesting story Then with Cruella we got her origin story And despite what people think aka how can they try to redeem dog killer this wasn a redemption at all in the timeline since this was her in her early and the Dalmatians Cruella is in her s That being said for some

seventh movie where became fan simply loved director effort of Justin Lin James Wan and Gary Gray Those were NAMES also like side characters and their actors like Kurt Russel Scott Eastwood Jason Statham The Rock possibly his best role Luke Evans or Tony Jaa But something tells me that they should ve stop after the eight one That was the biggest peak also really enjoy Hobbs and Shaw which reminds me lot movies like Bad Boys Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour It was really good movie with also fantastic cast Vanessa Kirby Hellen Mirren Idris Elba Eiza Gonzales and her scenes Like proper action flick But from the moment was announce just felt that this isn right Justin Lin didn succeed with Star Trek Beyond he killed that franchise and coming back with sterile film This series did many thing wrong and crazy impossible at least But they didn reviving characters just like that What they did with Han completely destroys this franchise for good Leaving all the side characters outside was another misstep And Vin Diesel as the only hero of this franchise is just wrong The only replacement for Paul Walker should be Scott Eastwood or at least Statham maybe even The Rock Not the melodrama between Vin and Michelle And now even Justin is gone and some no name director directs the finale of the franchise So sad really like the franchise to the eight entry Now cannot see it Vin became worse than The Rock And was fan of his project Fast Riddick XXX and his vision for Hannibal the Conqueror He should retire ', 'Yeah the whole vibe of the movie and the overall seriousness changed with

wisest at picking her roles lately but shes still an incredible actress These Razzie nominated roles of hers are actually not terrible performances they are just in terrible movies and the poor lady just did the best she could with the material she was given Frankly read The Woman in the Window and the book itself was garbled mess that was trying to capitalize on the widespread success of The Girl on the Train and Gone Girl the TGOTT adaptation had its own issues but was still significantly better than TWITW and recall thinking while reading this that any film adaptation was likely going

by that movie There so much wrong with it and my biggest gripe is that the main plot makes zero sense So the Japanese casino owner wants to make billions by getting the head of special zombie and

even need to hire mercenaries He was shown hosting generals Department of Defense officials at his home None of those high ranking officials could put together team to grab zombie head For that matter why the shit did the military need the Japanese dude at all The military controlled the no fly zone over Las Vegas so they could ve just sent in chopper with single team of elite soldiers to go in

in my top favorite movies of the But never have enjoyed any of his shows They are all way too overly melodramatic Those Who Wish Me Dead was also terrible adaptation to pretty good book too He one of

blame him for the amount of money he making and for all the people that enjoy his shows But it very possible his best writing is behind him He wrote that Neo western trilogy before Sicario was

timely Pretty terrible propaganda ', 'Definitely For my part didn like how Chastain character was able to express discomfort and disgust with the torture programs but the eagerly take the intelligence gained and go act on it Her buddy was presented as doing terrible thing out of practical necessity for the greater good It was hugely arrogant of the film to try to convince us that torture was both abhorrent and sometimes genuinely necessary It utterly glossed over the hypocritical reservations that many Americans had As matter of historical accuracy the CIA consistently claimed their torture programs produced actionable intelligence in the hunt for Bin Laden Senate investigation challenges that story but that was the narrative The movie simply asks us to accept that it happened the way

about high speed operators kicking down doors this movie kicks ass and crushes bud lights ', 'I love Zero Dark Thirty it told the story of the hunt for Bin Laden in the most entertaining way that

is descended from the first minority and first person ever recorded on film Yeun is child actor and becomes performer feel like Yeun is good example for race reading of the film Of the family he the only one to survive physically unscathed The monkey seems to connect with him Perhaps it recognizes they are similarly mistreated by the media That said others make compelling arguments that this was because he was the only one inadvertently respecting it Yeun will never grow from that experience further opting in to the performer side of his life He leans in to the stage name Jupiter showing his flaw of his misunderstanding animals by equating himself to the alien itself being the sky and storms The cowboy image he uses is quintessentially American It connotations with American film are inseparable The strongest case for the race reading is Daniel Kaluuya at the start when he handling Lucky for the ad crew Others mentioned he looks really nervous shy think that because he supposed to be the animal in some sense He very nervous in front of the crew unlike his sister who a natural at performing He doesn make eye contact with the crew who basically stares him down showing that they re unable to engage with the rules of the observed It looks as if the cinematographer is filming him Speaking of him he is ride or die for entertainment The protagonist qualities the movie values are empathy for the performer Kaluuya is the only person with empathy for the horses and the alien The woman is interesting she is extremely white blue eyes huge blond hair and old in caricature that feels like shorthand for white bitch This is backed up by the director engaging her in conversation super positively and treating Kaluuya like shit Another detail OJ is named after OJ Simpson huge development in media treating horrific stories of violence as entertainment Everyone in the film is complicit in this Yeun trains the alien who inadvertently kills MC dad with emphasis on the coin dealing the lethal blow and the in god we trust message on it as if to say God has no jurisdiction here It almost feels like the real start of the movie is the patriarch the protector of the land dying and the crowd OJ wants to catch the alien and make money barely acknowledging when Angel mentions they could save the world Emerald plugs her business at the start The meaning as far as can tell is that we should be more thoughtful when consuming violence media The alien can harm one who doesn observe it and physically resembles an old camera Also the observation that it tries to resemble what we want is so fascinating And then there the fact that it a uterus basically no idea what to make of it Maybe women are harmed by the normalization of violence media Or that they re culprits in it since every single woman on planet earth loves true crime documentaries The race reading of the meaning of the film still holds up Yeun not learning from the past goes back in to performance and gets fucked up Emerald is fine performing but the ending emphasizes her ordeal more than it does for OJ who does not perform at all Man this movie was good Loved reading the discussion and thinking about it during the film ', 'NGL she did so good of job there is no way Jackie Chan could have lived up She beyond and above my top spot for Best Actress of the year right now Like what fuckin

his body instead of turning him into actual clay It all depends on the angle and the CGI Penguin wasn a penguin just guy with scars and limp m just sad they didn give him an umbrella We ve already seen Two Face Joker and Scarecrow done more realistically The Mad Hatter would be super easy to do it just mental illness They even turned Riddler into something believable and not Jim Carrey although adore those movies still almost too grounded Poison Ivy would also be super easy if you leave out most of the more fantastical stuff Just make her doctor trying to stop climate change mean that kinda how most modern movies roll anyway now she gets so frustrated that she resorts to eco terrorism and starts experimenting on herself splices her body with plant DNA or whatever and gets some mild powers but mainly uses concoctions to poison people and fast growing weeds to destabilize buildings or whatever Sadly talent is not something d associate with modern movie writers anymore The Batman

by the end was frequently checking my phone to see when this movie would end There a large chunk of this film that could be cut out and nothing would be lost imo The characters themselves were also not that interesting was not fan of emo Bruce Wayne and Catwoman didn have enough of personality for me to care about her missing girlfriend or her daddy issues This film was so heavy with it exposition in the mystery story that it forgot to breath and have character moments seriously wonder what the ratio of Batman to Bruce Wayne screentime in this movie is think it would easily be the highest of any batman film cause this movie barely had Bruce himself in it Riddler was good but not great will admit liked the idea of Riddler being fan of the Batman but the interrogation scene really turned me off on him His screeching and moaning was more cringe worthy rather than frightening to me Also the Joker tease at the end Batman has probably the largest rogue gallery of excellent villains to pull from Mr Freeze Scarecrow Hugo Strange the Mad Hatter Poison Ivy etc know Joker is his most iconic enemy but this is legit going to be our th joker in the last years just eye rolled at

deal with in the west Or for live action like to point out that in the west in the Back to the Future was pretty big In the in China Mister Vampire comedy about hopping jiang shi zombies that cant see

is just bit too weird for western audiences to really get into Edit like there are just concepts that are so different Moxibustion for example or comedy moles on characters the comic relief often has huge mole ', 'It how would describe Wish Dragon Masterpiece no Fun time Yes It succeeds at being such good time as movie that would almost genuinely consider it masterpiece on that merit alone ', 'Well just by the fact that you didnt even finish the movie this is already review not to be fully taken seriously Its one thing to say something like it was so bad had to take break in the middle but to say that you literally never finished it is whole other thing Also idk what your whole year old target demo shtick is about Wish Dragon touches on way more mature themes than Aladdin does and the characters specifically the main cast are more grounded in my opinion For one the true antagonist so to speak of this film which impedes Din the whole way is the socioeconomic divide he tries to overcome while actively avoiding wishing for money whereas in Aladdin the peasant princess relationship which should be integral is nothing more than minor hurdle in the grand scheme of things while an actual conniving villain influences things behind the scenes Not that theres anything wrong with that implicitly its just that villains like Jafar are far more geared towards younger audiences since its easier to understand Dins relationship with Li Na is almost never portrayed as anything more than platonic think youre just suffering from what Id call male female leads syndrome where you automatically assume the leads end up together Most of your plot holes arent actually plot holes It didnt have to be on the day of the party but why shouldnt it be In Dins mind that probably makes it nicer to socialize dont think its problem that Li Nas dad knew about the teapot its probably legend thats been passed down Also the convenient timing could be explained by the intentions of God who specifically gave Din the teapot distinct difference from Aladdin whose chosen nature is lot more vague and sort of indirect Also Don didnt wish to be prince for day he wished to have all the benefits of being rich for day Theres similarity there sure but the fact you equates them directly by misplacing Dins wish kind of shows that your comparisons are more based on confirmation bias probably from after seeing the trailer than actual observation Dins character being an optimist and not expecting the worst isnt plot hole its personality trait Hes portrayed as smart but his actions are clearly informed more by his intuition and emotions Hes always got an idealistic outlook on the world and thats not contradiction Now if that idealist world were constantly reaffirmed Id actually call that pretty good critique but its not His world views are challenged and he eventually hits low point that he needs to recover from The thing with the fight scene looking like he doesnt have control is actually pretty valid criticism imo though think they do better job at making his fights more intentional later on Although even if he ends up not literally knowing how to fight its not like thats any better than Aladdin wishing to be prince and essentially being given prince costume and parade Aladdin never actually becomes prince until he marries Jasmine which was out of the Genies control meaning that the Genie failed to fulfill the wish Personally never had any issues with the animation design or the lip syncing so Id just say that the animation is more of preference thing and that its possible missed bad sync think that the many surface level similarities are simply meant to be little referenced This movie isnt ripoff but it is definitely love letter to the original and it wears that on its sleeve dont really see any of that as problem', ' If you for some reasons dislike it then move on It is just Netflix cartoon movie Don state your opinions if they re negative is good way to get to place where nothing improves Please stop saying stuff like this Criticism is good and necessary Aladdin is great cartoon movie Wish Dragon is bad one Hopefully it gets critiqued and the next cartoon movie to come out is good rather than bad ', 'Just watched Outside the Wire really good', 'I enjoyed Outside the Wire quite bit It not masterpiece by any means but it a decent movie with some good twists ', 'Some of the streaming services do pretty well in filling the gap At least for the stuff watch Netflix for example has TON of new sci fi space movies that nobody has heard of They re not gonna win any Oscars but they re entertaining and it definitely satisfies the watch random robot alien movie jones Am Mother is really good IMHO and really enjoyed Spectral Outside the Wire

is solid there was just something underwhelming about how it came together watched this and Outside the Wire New Netflix Anthony Mackie Film this weekend This was better But do want to watch their previous movies everyone says are good They were hyped up with the announcement that they are directing lot of Moon Knight ', 'Not good movie The title Outside the Wire is wasted here ', 'A lot of these movies show up on Amazon shortly after whatever theatrical release they get here in the UK Theyre almost like the movies Bruce Willis has been doing but kind of okay Aside from The Marksman

action movies where pretty good and quite enjoy watching them After while you ll know what you get so if you like one them you ll probably like the others Some examples Cold pursuit the marksman

lukewarm BVS was mess Suicide Squad was okay in places Wonder Woman got it right felt interested in who she was and her story The supporting characters were great and interesting in their own ways The marksman who can shoot but can sing Who has nightmares about who knows what The soldier who wanted to be an actor But was force into another role The chief who lost his home yet doesn resent those who took it and found way to make his own life good and fufilling All interesting and loved it ', 'The Dig It about the excavation of the Sutton Hoo burial site and the man who uncovered it Basil Brown It a very good film ', 'Im not saying that youre wrong for feeling this way but think that the scene where Sam Neils character is fucking with the kid at the dig site scaring him with the raptor claw is supposed to be the scene that attaches you to him You see what hes passionate about and you see what kind of guy he is hes serious about his work but hes able to have laugh He doesnt particularly like kids wanting and having kids and the responsibility of caring for them is huge underlying theme in the first Jurassic Park movies He literally insists couple times that kids smell Babies smell We then later in the movie see his character suddenly forced to hang out with and take care of two kids in life or death situations Its funny and interesting because we know how difficult it is for himbut hes also good at it We see him changing and growing Were invested in this change that hes undergoing If you dont click into that then itd be really hard to care about the action surrounding that emotional core But will say that one of the things appreciate about the original Jurassic Park is that these emotional character elements are not dumped on you in single expository conversation You see it in bits and pieces of naturally occurring conversation between the characters If you arent focused on the movie and the dialog if you dont remember the previous mentions of kids or character details then the emotional arc wont be very apparent to you Watching movies without phone anywhere near you can be extremely beneficial to keeping your focus and not missing out on these important details that build the emotional core of film movie ', 'That another good choice for adaptation The Dig could be good film as well the game script was written by Steven Spielberg and Orson Scott Card never played

underrated but still managed to snatch an Oscar nom for adapted screenplay Its on Netflix ', 'That is fantastic Just watched this last night and was blown away at how good it was Unflinching look at whats coming did have one moment in the film where practically yelled at the screen It was Josh Brolins character yelling at Blunts character about how this is what happens when million people in the states won stop snorting or injecting cocaine and that is the reason for all of this horror BULLSHIT The reason is because TPTB have instituted prohibition on stuff that people want thereby creating black market for these goods at prices that allows the rise of criminal gangs who create the violence and corruption that we see today Legalize it all and all of the negatives go away At worst you deal with treatment for addicts Of course this was coming from CIA operative whose agency was integral in the drug trade so they can make money to pay for black ops all over the world ', 'I just watched Redemption Day thinking how bad can it be The answer was pretty bad ', 'I watched that Shadow in the Cloud movie with her in it on Hulu It was weird movie with mishmash of different things But

sure if there were any other leading roles available for her besides these in Mother Android Shadow in the Cloud or Tom amp Jerry tbf she probably got paid lot for that she would have taken them

interesting story But for me when it translated on screen it all didn come together don know if it was the way the talking animals were done the tone of the film or what But it felt cheesy at times and not believable Shadow in the cloud One of my favorite screenplays thrill ride from page to the end But when watched the film the soundtrack was very out of place lot of the action came off as comedic The Gremlin on screen was more reminiscent of syfy channel film than than what terrified me on the page The scene where the main character climbs under the plane to save her baby was so cheesy really enjoyed the story from the screenplay but the action and choices made from the production and post production really ruined the film for me To balance these criticisms scripts that really enjoyed before the films were released that came out great include deadpool and quiet place ', 'Once Upon Time in the West isnt exactly some hidden gem its one the most highly rated westerns of all time and for good reason not really sure what you were expecting there Yesterday watched Shadow in the Cloud and was thoroughly entertained by it It is largely remake of well know Twilight Zone episode but it does very good job at expanding upon it What was the most surprised was when went to rate the film on IMDB was its really low score have yet to come across such big divide on rating and films quality on the site Had seen the rating first may have not even bothered to watch it because films below usually start to become very iffy in their production quality but in this that was topnotch Only thing can imagine why people hated it was the dialogue but to me it was just exaggerated way army guys talk and films always exaggerate things for bigger impact on the audience so that didnt bother me ', 'Shadow in the Cloud was excited for horror movie set on WW bomber The first half of the movie is genuinely pretty good But as soon as Maude Garrett leaves the ball turret the rest of the movie becomes ridiculous cartoony mess The tone shift gave me whiplash Ended up hating it This is way back in high school but our English teacher showed us Romeo Juliet the one with Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes We were hype to see Shakespeare with guns and it was awful Haven seen it in about decade now so it probably not even that bad just very disappointing to my teenage self ', 'I ve actually come to really enjoy redbox for its options especially in the last year While you might not recognize the titles there are some very good and unique titles that pass thru like The Wretched

badass army of one trope done better by John wick Its got the save protect child trope God hate this one but done better in something like Logan The father figure dying trope The female side character

Tarantino references this is with the whitewashing of Westerns QT had black cowboys in Django and Hateful Eight and in reality many cowboys were black Mexicans of mixed heritage or Native Americans but in our depiction of the Wild West we see white English speaking Anglos In fact of the original founders of the Pueblo of Los Angeles only two were white All of the Mexican characters in this movie are in subservient roles the valets the doorman etc So what gives think QT is making an artistic point that by whitewashing the history of the West we are perpetuating racism and the depiction is overshadowing the actual event The more obvious version of this theme is that the Mansons and other terrorists control society by virtue of their targets which they choose to instill fear in the populace The depiction of the crimes are more important than the actual crime Can we honestly say the Mansons would have just as big part in our culture if they had murdered random people instead of filmmakers Cliff and his wife is another version of this theme did he kill his wife We see in the final scenes that he had the physical capability but the film ultimately leaves it ambiguous as to whether he did or not But guess what it doesn fucking matter whether he actually did it or not because the depiction the belief that he did has overshadowed his life and affected his ability to get jobs ', 'Yes She did herself no favours by participant in this documentary From the very beginning he said he didnt like children Gee wonder why Its absolutely sickening to watch Mia admits in the first episode she walked in on him with his face in their Dylans lap She knew he was intense with Dylan but he claimed it was all non sexual so She believed him He is sick pervert no question but she failed her children truly And in the end of this weeks episode he comes over and tries to Mia about the photos and she doesnt immediately call the police She was living in Manhattan all she had to do was tell the doorman to come or have the doorman call the police He stayed for four hours could go on and on and on Woody is censored Mia is censored if she thought appearing in this documentary was

Murder Manual Ava and The Doorman were all pretty abysmal There were few of those movies could have shut off early but stuck through them WW was terrible and long but it kept me minimally engaged supposed it could get an award for biggest budget flop Guess it depends how it does making any money back but it far from the worst movie thst came out this year ', 'The point of the ending is that it could have been Palantine instead of Sport and the Doorman Travis just wants an outlet for his pain for his suffering to be acknowledged The media celebrates him because they deem those he killed fit to die hes time bomb ticking away My interpretation of Taxi Driver is that Travis is very easy to sympathise with lot of people see the ugly side of themselves in Travis Its only in the later scenes that we see him become more detached and unhinged As he descends into insanity the viewer is asking themselves Is this the same man sympathised with earlier What does that say about me dont really agree with your nd paragraph art should be unrestricted in its process people need human outlet where they can be human flawed but functional no outlet leads to Travis Thats just my opinion not hating on you just love the movie ', 'It a great movie inspired by the work of Franz Kafka Black Mirror at times also has shades of Kafka The doorman even directly quotes Kafka which is great joke that works on many levels The basic idea is that Paul is both victim of society because the rules of social interaction are often arbitrary and people are weird and victim of his own tendency to overthink human relationships combined with lack of empathy Some observations The key symbolizes way into community Paul irrational fear for the key symbolizes his fear of social interaction Also the exact same thing happened to me once bet the scene was based on somebody personal experience The doorman quoting Kafka is part of the running joke that everybody in SoHo has artistic airs Paul not understanding that the doorman is doing bit is symptomatic of his social awkwardness Paul becoming statue is among other things sly reference to Kafka Die Verwandlung People who love After Hours should read Kafka unless they are prone to depression ', 'Characters confuse Constanta for Bonanza elsewhere in the series like when the doorman tells Dalrymple theres George Bonanza here to see him Checks out to me Thats the

work out howie always saw an angle to play and in the end think he had resolved to dying the second he decided not to call up his girlfriend to call off the bet he planned it to be his final noble act of sacrifice to try and make up for lifetime of fucking people over it was probably the first time he has felt loved by anyone in long time and was okay with dying as long as she had the money so kind of redemption guess and the mob guy didnt give fuck about the money he plays by different rules and howie crossed the line by gambling money that wasnt his to gamble and the doors the thugs wont be

taken aback All of his crew are nudging each other and sniggering and Frank knows hes fucked so he peels off and hands it to the kid who opens the door and lets everyone through But Frank hangs back

it badly and she used sex to attempt to get it think the only thing close in contemporary media was Anna Nicole Smith who unfortunately wasn nearly as bright as Monroe and had worse outcome Another aspect due to the time period is that that sort of blatant sexiness wasn common It had bit of legitimacy that fell away after the mid with low budget nudie flicks ala Russ Meyer All the women were

different way still don understand why didn feel it at first It seems Jim Parsons received overall positive with little mixed reviews with his interpretation of Michael m happy for him Some people say

of knowledge and experience like the critics from Breakfast All Day or Mark Kermode or the people who run Indiewire Film Talk podcast or in the past the Av Club film reviews because they are looking to dig deep and analyze film and they can recognize homages or references that as more recent film fan just can It also depends on if film speaks to particular experience recently watched The Boys in the Band and really enjoyed it but m not gay man or even in the LGBTQ community also had no idea about the storied history of the play or the previous film or any of that so checked out the Pop Culture Happy Hour episode about it which had four critics who all happen to be gay men as well as listening to the Breakfast All Day episode since one of those critics is an older gay man who had significant knowledge about the original film and the play etc It not that other critics can or shouldn have opinions about these films but m always curious to see if films like this resonate with the groups of people they are attempting to portray Do they feel authentic or stereotypical real or dated and hackneyed While it true that critics can generally give you an idea if something is worth seeing feel that their real aim is approaching film from the lens of film canon Where does it fit in what is it trying to do what are the themes and messages inherent in it Film critics are to film

regional Indian movie that stuck with me and got pulled back up into my mind after watched it The movie is of man who is known for perennially fixing things for others an under rated scatterbrained commoner who everybody loves for being there for them in his little town often at the expense of his own challenges In the movie woman asks the protagonist why he okay running around for other people often even if it means he might not be as successful as he could be if he was singularly focused on making just his dreams come true And he says with wry smile how in the game of Lemon and Spoon the aim is not to reach the finish line as soon as possible The aim is to make sure that your lemon is well within your spoon till the end In life your big and small dreams may not come true what you foresaw life to mean and be the big picture might not always materialize but at the end of the day if your lemon is within your spoon if the people you love and cherish are by your side no matter your level or definition of accomplishment then you re lucky That his definition of victory am surrounded by large loving bunch of family and friends at all times but often fight bouts of feeling like don bring much to the table that don deserve good company and that m too small to live out this big life But the fact that Evelyn could have had any of those lives where she was magnificent and successful and talented and where her daughter could have been anything else brought tears to my eyes Maybe if day comes when my mother and father and sister and the horde of loving friends that has stuck around despite everything else were given the same choice do you want life where could be something else something better would you take her or would you stick with the same daughter friend sister maybe they

quite good and thoroughly enjoyed it ', 'I care lot the premise pissed me off but ended up enjoying it lot ', 'the character of Marla from Care Lot could be considered complex and morally ambiguous character driven by greed and power who manipulates and exploits vulnerable individuals for her own gain The portrayal of Marla by Rosamund Pike has been widely praised for its complexity and nuance highlighting the actress ability to convey wide range of emotions and motivations As for the question of whether she is the biggest asshole in movie it ultimately matter of personal opinion as different people will have different perspectives on the characters and their actions ', 'I dont know if this applies but the women from Care Lot Theyre not really portrayed as being right Theyre meant to be bad people but the idea its trying to push is they are unstoppable intelligent badasses that cheat the system get that bag sis movie Youre supposed to root for them but as the movie goes on you just find yourself begging the writers to kill them off but your just left empty handed No movie has ever made me more mad ', 'I have never passionately hated protagonist more then Rosamund

gives them more time to develop the character That being said Joffrey Baratheon gets my vote Little shithead made me hate him so much and the actor seems such nice fella irl which is weird In movie it has to be Rosamund Pike in Care Lot She made me hate her lot LOT Same with Gone Girl not as much but she really is great actress to bring those emotions out ', 'I watched Care Lot under the label of

interesting if rushed conclusion ', 'I was extremely agitated the entire time watched Care Lot to the point where almost didnt finish it The concept of the film was really frustrating Theres nothing

piece of trash', 'Funny Games Don remember lot about it but it was too frustrating and enraging to watch Care Lot Because of the exploitation of the older people and the writers inability to do any

system against her shitty male rivals and against drug cartel by having her come to some last minute realisation or preferably realistic horrible end But no she picks up some secret agent abilities and beats the cartel and establishes herself as major player in the industry Thankfully she does kick the bucket in the end but the film presents her as the winner even then Horrible misjudgement of

about', 'I care lot Rosamund pike best vilain', 'While dont think this movie exactly fits my request it is one of the few Ben Affleck movies that truly enjoyed Rosamund Pike was perfect for her role

decently its romcom called days she was also in the broken hearts gallery and bad education and both were good decent', 'The Broken Hearts Gallery Theres so much love about this movie not sure if its exactly what youre looking for but still HIGHLY recommend', 'I loved Brooklyn with Saoirse Ronan Emory Cohen and Domhnall Gleeson Can go wrong with Love Simon starring Nick Robinson d also recommend the more recent The Broken Hearts Gallery with Geraldine Viswanathan and Dacre Montgomery ', 'The Broken Hearts Gallery is romantic comedy which can be dirty term to some Understandably so as there are plenty of stinkers out there under the romcom banner This however isn one of those no this is charming and impressive directorial debut by Natalie Krinksy It is genuinely funny and filled with numerous laugh out loud moments It witty and intelligent and portrays world that easy to get engrossed in as it populated by cast of bright and diverse characters who are easy to love There is plenty to admire and enjoy here particularly when acknowledging it a debut effort But given few things in cinema are perfect there are few mostly minor negatives to acknowledge so let do that first Whilst the soundtrack of the film is inoffensive and there nothing egregiously wrong with it m also personally not the biggest fan of mass produced modern pop and it did feel moderately out of place on few occasions Whilst by no means frequent there are also moments when the dialogue feels somewhat sloppy Occasionally feeling stilted and in few moments somewhat cheesy However this is far from the norm and on the whole The Broken Hearts Gallery is excellently written managing dialogue that feels at once grounded and real whilst retaining some stylised and elevated elements Plus aside from anything else the comedic beats in the film are largely hilarious frequent and well timed The only other criticism worth noting is that the film does occasionally lose focus leading to infrequent moments of messiness These briefly pose the question of where we re going or the exact purpose of couple of scenes This isn a major detractor or common across the film runtime the vast majority of which is slickly and stylishly directed whilst always retaining its aforementioned charm and heart It is that all encompassing charm that carries this When Harry Met Sally for the hipster age very long way Whilst don think TBHG is quite on the level of the great Rob Reiner movie that is hardly surprising given WHMS is the gold standard for romance based comedy This film certainly owes debt of gratitude to WHMS and has echoes of its DNA most plainly emphasised by its cute social media styled intermediate video vignettes which break up the film much in the same way as our check ins with friendly elderly couples in WHMS just in an updated format By no means should my comparisons between the two movies be seen as criticism or diminishing what has been created here quite the opposite in fact mean to pay both TBHG and Natalie Krinsky sincere compliment Certainly the film stands on its own two feet with confidence and possesses several unique elements with which Krinsky makes the film her own One of these unique elements that gives the film its own flavour are the stylised and superbly choreographed breaks in the film traditional storytelling Best exemplified by sweet moment in the first act when our main character Lucy is comforted after typical romcom bad break up Said moment is filmed in an immaculately choreographed and stylish series of slowed down shots which serves to accentuate the moment There are several of these choreographed moments they re fun whimsical and visually splendid They give the film which moves at an otherwise brisk pace chance to breathe We are of course retreading some familiar ground here in places which feel rather goes with the territory fear romantic comedy is one of the genres that is rather challenging to totally innovate within All your classic elements can be found here bad break ups typical will they won they dynamic scenes of our love interests in separate locations but rushing to meet one another grand gestures which are acknowledged within the film in tongue in cheek self aware fashion and big romantic monologues Despite this it does retain feeling of freshness and despite being predictable that no bad thing and it never feels cliched The cinematography on display was nice highlight It not standard or stale which goes long way to giving it visual identity Shot in warm rich and neony totally word colour palette it feels cosy and suits the movie tone to tee There are numerous shots taken from interesting angles and some shot at non standard speeds The shot selection and visual language which Krinsky and cinematographer Alar Kivilo have created is impressive and polished All that is good and enjoyable here is best encapsulated and personified by TBHG wonderful cast of which there are no weak links Geraldine Viswanathan as Lucy and Dacre Montgomery as Nick are both incredibly endearing putting in electric performances in the lead roles Viswanathan in particular is equal parts smart charming funny and fierce powerful and independent woman and wonderful to see in this kind of film Honourable mentions also go to Molly Gordon as Amanda and Phillipa Soo as Nadine who bring an edge and some dark humour to their supporting roles which is most pleasing Arturo Castro too is funny and disarming in his role as Nick best friend Marcos There is an easy and joyous camaraderie between everyone on screen together for much of the movie Bernadette Peters is pitch perfect casting as pretentious and glamorous gallery owner Eva Woolf Not forgetting to mention Nathan Dale as Jeff who has quietly humorous build up to his character throughout the movie and who pay off is one of the funniest gags in the whole film So in short would highly go recommend anyone to go and see this provided it is safe in your location to visit the cinema To support talented filmmaker debut and just to have much needed feel good fun time It well written sharply paced and has talented and hilarious cast The cinematic needs more efforts like this films which pay homage to and have classic cinema DNA but do something uniquely their own with it Whilst the cycle of cinematic sequels reboots and remakes do produce good stuff feel films like The Broken Hearts Gallery are sign we can have balance in cinema and truly hope it does well ', 'I saw the The Broken Hearts Gallery and thought it was great very

absolutely hilarious The depicted motives and world view of school shooters was so ungrounded in reality it was comedy gold Run Hide Fight Was easily the funniest thing had ever seen since The Reliant

my expectations Remaking Die Hard with school shooting as backdrop is one of the worst ideas for film ve ever heard of and this film is just as bonkers as expected What didn expect was the level of professional polish it has The direction by Kyle Rankin is solid work The performances with the exception of that lead school shooter were strong didn like that lead boy because his performance didn match the established tone He seems to be drawing his inspiration from Heath Ledger Joker and Alan Rickman in Die Hard Way too hammy for my tastes Another head scratching idea was to include Zoey dead mother as character to dialogue with It didn work at all for me And that ending was sickening In the end she becomes just as ruthless as the terrorists She finds the Joker kid in creek and decides to blow hole through his chest She grabs her father hunting rifle to do it which recalls the opening scene Unlike that scene though she decides not to finish him and just leaves him to die slow agonizing death This instantly made her just as corrupt as the shooters and it just turned my stomach This movie has pretty despicable worldview suppose my reaction makes me woke liberal or whatever ', 'Looks

with some stupid fictional side story that feels like it ripped out of lifetime movie ', 'Honestly m kind of grateful for Tiger King it definitely made me lot more vigilant about documentaries pushing

attacked Its unbearable at times ', 'I actually think these are both essential viewing one after the other think would recommend watching the Social Dilemma first just to get sense of the scope of the problems with how social distorts and then Agents of Choas to see exactly how the Russian troll farm uses social media to manipulate people Both are very engrossing and very important viewing for everyone ', 'Yes everyone should watch The Social Dilemma and all agree that the scripted portions of the movie were really terrible Everything else was good though ', 'I would argue that the content of the social dilemma may be more be even more immediately important than this but dont take my word for it watch both ', 'I thought The Social Dilemma took an important issue and portrayed it in disjointed and often ridiculous fashion It tended to emphasize the wrong issues and didn spend nearly enough time on practical solutions Haidt who was briefly shown in the documentary actually covers these issues considerably more effectively in his lectures ', 'I am genuinely curious as to the appeal of The Social Dilemma What about this movie works for people really tried with it but find that its attempts to mix drama and documentary render both elements less poignant If any other documentary spliced in what feels like skits about the social issue theyre talking about they be laughed at ', 'I think it does good job of explaining it in layman terms for people not that technology savvy When most people think AI they think along the lines of the Terminator and androids which makes it seem like this far future thing not something that we already have and is already affecting our daily lives The immediate danger of AI isn that it will become sentient it is more that it isn sentient in that it can think or analyse more abstract human ideas Via recommendation AIs we have world being heavily affected minute by minute by something that doesn understand or take into account the consequences of it actions It does sensationalise it bit in the cringey dramatisations but then social media has helped create world where most people will only pay attention to sensationalised information The ultimate takeaway got from the social dilemma wasn that Facebook and Twitter etc are evil companies hellbent on rigging elections and turning people into hate machines morally bankrupt yes but it is lot easier to make those decisions when you are massively detached from the people they will affect or don really understand the affects it will have More that they are incompetent and are using technology they can really control most AIs are black box when it comes to how they made specific decision we can see the data but it rarely makes sense to human and refuse to put it back in the box because they have to keep making higher and higher profits to please shareholders Which also explains why efforts to curb the spread of fake news has mostly been manual how do you teach an AI what truth is As good as they are at working towards scorable goal they still don think they can critically analyse what they recommend They recommend fake news because they don know the difference people are more likely to read sensationalised headlines and fake news tends to be more sentionalized As was noted at the end of the doc they need to be forced to stop using this stuff via regulation

thing for sure that film soundtrack is INSANE had whole argument with someone who wouldn believe me when said that The Prayer came from THIS movie lol It sounds like some kind of joke until you

story on the basis that its kids movie is nonsense Stories like the Lion King or Mulan are all fantastic stories filled with emotions that are meant for kids but every age demographic can still enjoy

remembers the movie but Mulan was wrong on so many accounts Yes Ik forced marriage is not an ideal situation but when literally fucking war will start that will lead to thousands maybe even millions dying if you don get married m sorry but think you need to bite the bullet at that point Yes we don wanna be caught in shitty marriage but is it really right to just have war that ll probably end

glad that weve moved into an era where Disney princesses have an actual noble motivation Mulan does heroic actions to save her father and her country Ariel does is just infatuated with cute boy and risks ruining her kingdom for it ', 'The Last Airbender honestly is so bad its not so bad its good but you asked for it lol Terrible acting somehow ruined an awesome story and characters mean

so bad its almost good mean man what dumb movie Matt Smith looks like hes having fun in like three scenes at least Suicide Squad is fun bad movie what are we some kinda suicide squad sums it up Also most of the cast actually give genuinely good fun performances Jared Leto Joker and few others are hot mess though IMO so youll get some legit enjoyment Personally though my favorite bad movie is easily Venom Is it quite possibly the stupidest thing Ive ever watched Yes Did have an absolute blast watching it Hell yes Tom hardy is just so much fun this is definitely my go to so bad its good

movies out there ', 'I say it was few things all coming together to create one big shitstorm for unfortunately The early D films weren really doing well critically compared to Pixar and Dreamworks CG films Disney D films were costing them more to make but not bringing in the money to justify it compared to Pixar stuff which was often cheaper to make And think big thing was people being excited about the new animation style like you said feel like if films like Aladdin The Lion King Beauty and the Beast The Little Mermaid The Hunchback of Notre Dame Mulan Tarzan were coming out at the same time as Monsters Inc Finding Nemo The Incredibles really feel like Disney D films would ve still made money and maybe wouldn gone away at that time ', 'Ah didn watch that one It looked bit to filled with CGI and bit like those China sponsored films that makes out China as perfect country g The Mulan remake the Karate Kid remake ', 'No screw all the political connotations the movie was awful The

that Mulan was as authentic as possible So that kind of sets the expectation dont you think In all my work that is centered in cultures not my own hope that comes through because that is incredibly important to me In the promotion and PR thats what theyve been emphasizing So they over promised and underdelivered Should have ignored the PR Sure But didnt went into the film with that mindset Can forget about it and suspend my disbelief Sure In the end am disappointed because it had lot of potential for being good remake or good reimagining and it was neither The cultural appropriation is insult to injury Lots of things in the movie that makes people familiar with the culture scratch their head Cinema has history of exploiting culture for its foreign exoticism And in Disney is still did it with Mulan Culture Mythology History Etc Its important because its peoples culture butchered by person who clearly doesnt understand or butcher it Again wouldnt expect it but the director said In all my work that is centered in cultures not my own hope that comes through because that is incredibly important to me Which is bullshit ', 'I think it a mixture of purple realizing that this is cash grab for Disney by playing on the nostalgia for many young adults and the quality simply not being as good as the originals By the way Mulan has to be one of the most disappointing of the remakes

this year This was one of the most generic and painful films to sit through love Liam Neeson give him slack because hes always seemed like good guy But boy is he in some numbers This movie struggles to communicate with the audience properly The dialogue is straight out of Grade English class The acting fits the bill too even Neeson who doesnt give much to this role Jai Courtneys character is so childish and batshit insane Courtney completely overacts his part in this and it comes off almost childlike The movie consists mostly of him offing off his colleagues and then Neeson calling his SO

going to see this movie for its action you re better off literally taking your money and shoving it up your own ass because that will certainly be more thrilling as there is barely any action in this

comparing it to making movie about the Holocaust is nowhere near an accurate comparison and extremely insensitive This trash movie was made in the current time and Ive never seen movie about the Holocaust that didnt take place in the years of which the Holocaust took place So you see that is the issue with this woke trash and its just another one of the fifty movies that have come out in the past couple years that focus on white peoples bad and black peoples courageous and heroic Everyone is sick and tired of this same subject matter being pushed and promoted in everything from movies advertising sports and the list got on Its like our society just cant focus on the now and has to just constantly make the sad attempt to act like racism is stronger than ever Its just not true and continuing to promote it is unproductive and results in further division little unity would be nice and admitting that racism is not consuming our country would be great direction to go Racism is not some HUGE issue plaguing modern day America Equality exists and everyone is given the same opportunities if they are willing to work hard and be an honest productive member of society Do you here Jewish people criticizing and blaming current day Germany for the Holocaust No of course you dont because that would be absurd Dont you find it interesting that something as tragic as the Holocaust is not held over the head of modern day Germany but slavery in America is still largely blamed on modern day white people in America To be honest both times in history were horrible and shouldve never happened but keeping alive the lie that white people of today should feel responsible or accountable is pure insanity and fantasy Just like you would never tell modern day Germany that they are at fault for the Holocaust If youd like to share with us modern day movie that depicts Germans as current Day Holocaust members Id love to check that movie out will wait with the crickets and tumbleweeds because we both know no such movie exists And it will never exist because its completely insensitive to German people and paints them in picture that is completely unfair Hmmm kind of sounds similar

Both are gory tho ', 'The tax collector trailer was better than the film', 'Well just rewatched the original trailer to try and see if maybe had hindsight bias but think still stand by my opinion of the new trailer Everything is subjective obviously but that trailer while cool on its surface didnt really seem indicative of the final product even before the original came out You had David Ayer directing it and not saying hes bad director because hes not it didnt seem like hed be able to fulfill on the concept that trailer brought It was made out to look like some epic and deep massive movie which is just something hes never really done well as far as know Looking at his IMDb his directorial sheet doesnt really impress very much Bright did not do well at all and didnt care for it much The Tax Collector was barely okay it wasnt bad but nothing to rave about Ive never seen Fury but Ive heard good things Sabotage was garbage Harsh Times was okay but the casting was wasted talent The only movie on here actually liked was End Of Watch which is the exact opposite of the original suicide squad And then theres the cast Will Smith is great actor but it seems like his name is the reason lot of people get him for movies because hes often underutilized to his talents and Suicide Squad was one of those situations Ike Barinholtz is well if you know who he is you know hes not good actor And if you dont know who he is exactly Jared Leto is again good actor Hes shown it before But this was just bad performance If hed have channeled his energy into character other than Joker he could have done very well But feel that he looked at his performance as something that needed to be different Jack Nicholson Mark Hamill Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix all put forth very different Jokers and think Jared Leto was just trying to make his own footprint as his own Joker but it just didnt work at all know theres bunch of his footage left out of the final cut but It doesnt seem like any of that lost footage would be redeeming And Margot Robbie actually did decent job which Im sure is why shes in the new one as well Other than that dont recognize any other actors names although Im sure Ive seen them in other things but from their IMDb pages they dont have much filmography to go on for the most part just thing the director took shot and missed hard like couple of his other movies but the original Suicide Squad was something he was never going to be able to pull off And then you have the new one Directed by none other than James Gunn Someone who has shown countless times that he knows what hes doing in the director chair And he has Margot Robbie Idris Elba Michael Rooker Nathan Fillion John Cena Obviously like said its all subjective and we both have the right to make our own opinions but at the end of the day David Ayers Suicide Squad was out of the norm from what he knows and the cast wasnt strong enough to carry that negative From what Ive seen in the new trailer this seems exactly like the type of movie James Gunn knows how to direct plain and simple ', 'IDK after Bright and The Tax Collector have come to the conclusion that David Ayer isn a very good director', 'I see what you are saying about Heath Ledger He had certainly already proved he was compelling dramatic actor Nobody is questioning his already proven talent as an actor in general This is not case of Orlando Bloom suddenly pulling out great performance from nowhere Its undeniable however that pre Joker he wasnt known for his flamboyant or sinister roles and there was little on his CV that would suggest he could play beyond boyishly charming or quiet and introspective Mainly though every role even the dramatic ones leaned very heavily on his good looks The Joker is utter and unexpected transformation in this respect Im very impressed that you were not surprised by his performance Whoever was the casting director on the film clearly had the same instinct that you did based on his previous work but think it came out of pretty left field for most people already familiar with his work think your suggestions of Brad Pitt in Twelve Monkeys is great and somewhat similar to what most people experienced with Ledgers Joker Kevin Bacon in the Woodman rarely comes up in these debates but agree this is great call Maybe one of the best ones Ive heard Also completely agree about Lebeouf in Money Never Sleeps Whats interesting about Lebeouf is despite being pretty talented actor when cast to type neurotic slightly nerdy high energy he often gets cast against type and it very rarely works Along with Money Never Sleeps you can add Indy Constantine and The Tax Collector to the list Bill Murray in Razors Edge seems to be very contentious one as hear people saying it is great against type casting and others like yourself saying its terrible havent actually seen it but will certainly get round to doing so now ', 'Probably not all time but just watched The Tax Collector on Netflix

more satisfying trilogy For example Caedus could be really satisfying character in all the ways that Kylo Ren wasn really building up his motivation showing his damage and how he really believes he doing the right thing no matter the outcome would think be very compelling THEN we get to the really cool part the second trilogy which is an adaptation of the original Thrawn trilogy which culminates with the birth of the main characters from the first sequel trilogy reflecting the original movies but done with storylines that aren retreads of those original The Thawn adaptation is would be pretty straight forward and it be really cool to be able to address lot of the shortcomings certain characters experienced after that trilogy looking at you Mara Then we would get to an animated Young Jedi

realistically in America since the beginning of American film As the idea of the cowboy and The West real or not is essentially American lore and mythology it been the focus of related stories all along particularly since comparatively we are such young country It like you re saying that medieval knights or the Roman Empire in Europe or say Samurai in Japan is just niche thing that has no cultural significance All westerns also aren just one thing that are more or less the same Even with in the genre there some diversity that usually reflection of the culture There was the silent era and then William Hart era of Westerns that were one thing After that there was period of what was known as kiddie westerns or three and half day westerns that were just lot of action without much plot and they crank them out on budget shoot them in three and half days so they could afford to make money showing double matinee on Saturdays for kids When John Ford who basically the grandfather of American film wanted to make Stagecoach no studio wanted to give him the money for it despite his stature because they didn think adults would pay money to see western He found way to make it with half the money he usually get and proved them all wrong and kicked off an era of Hollywood westerns that were immensely popular for maybe four decades In the into the you started having first spaghetti westerns which were European interpretations of American westerns often produced in Germany and made in Italy by Italian filmmakers and would use and propel the careers of some American actors like Clint Eastwood which became hugely popular back in America where culturally the youth movement was at odds with the establishment and liked that they were different and broke the rules of traditional westerns and since that where the market was American films started to follow that trend In the and you sort of had hybrid of that as the new standard with some nostalgia for the old mixed in Obviously within any genre or time period different people are still liable to do things in their own way and you ll have some diversity Westerns have probably fallen off in popularity over the past to even as long as fifty years to what they had once been but they still happen and every generation is going to have their own take on westerns as they would anything else Beyond all of that for me good story is good story and good movie is good movie It shouldn matter whether it a western or not unless the whole concept is particularly revolting to you for some reason don know you or your tastes specifically but westerns have been made for well over hundred years now Like anything else they re going to run spectrum between good and bad but whatever your thing is my bet is that there are plenty of them that you like and no offense to Once Upon Time In The West but that one movie out of don know how many but no It not all downhill from there ', 'they are both tales of young men

they re publicly on the right side of every issue they re often doing more harm than good by pretending that problems don exist and when we do that problems don get solved Making film about person

how Guy de Lusignan is depicted as war monger who brought the war on himself and lost his army and kingdom through his own hubris The real Guy de Lusignan did not want war and had lot of doubts about his ability to win It was his war council particularly the Grand Master of the Knights Templar who pushed him to march on the horns of hattin And actually when you look into the details there were actually good reasons for giving battle to Saladin too many to go into here His relationship with his wife was also said to be very good and she even stuck by him after the fall of Jerusalem and during the siege of Acre where she died from plague She sure as hell would not have committed adultery with Balian de Ibelin very religious man who also wouldn have made some of the disparaging comments his character made in the movie about religion As for Balian he actually fought at the horns of hattin and was among few knights that managed to break out and escape He did defend Jerusalem and did knight people but only those who were already squires not commoners Saladin is also depicted in very magnanimous manner that is perhaps undeserved He did actually want to sack Jerusalem and we know this from letters he sent to the Caliph of Baghdad He changed his mind though after negotiated settlement with Balian by which terms the population had to pay fee to leave the city Balian and the Archbishop of the city another guy who also wrongly portrayed as as asshole in the movie raised funds to pay for the poorest people but there was still shortfall Saladin was chivalric enough to let some of those go free without paying but many others were enslaved could go on and on but the basics is that just about everything is wrong in this movie Still it is still entertaining as hell just be

finished watching Cut Throat City on Netflix Looking at the cast line up it looked to be more than just another rated movie Up and comers Denzel Whitaker and Demetrius Shipp Jr had me excited for this one staring next to names like I Terrence Howard Ethan Hawke Kat Graham and Isaiah Washington But should have known all bets were off on this being decent movie when saw Wesley Snipes was in it This movie takes place in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina It about four boyhood friends who turn to crime in order to make ends meet after the Hurricane thought this was going to be great move with I playing another gangster role but the plot kept moving in such weird direction its like the writer didn know where he wanted to go with this movie Most of the supporting characters in this movie had such vague background it made lot of the dialog and premise for their actions hard to understand At some points in the movie they keep talking about city official corruption on large scale but they never really get in to it what was done before Katrina m still trying to figure out what role or what was the point of having Terrence Howard or Wesley Snipes even in this movie Its like they brought Wesley Snipes in to be look alike of Samuel Jackson character in Black Snake Moan and Terrence Howard just to have another big name in the movie There are just so many WTFs in this movie that they never answer or circle back to Like the crocked cops that showed up at the Casino robbery in the start of the movie They talk about it once or twice but never say how they knew what was going down or who sent them This movie is just filled with so many elements and ideas that are never finished or talked about They introduce handful of things in this movie but never add any substance or closer on these things Wu Tang rapper Rza directed this and really think he is better off sticking to music or acting because this could have been such better movie with the cast that they had Sorry Vent done ', 'The first one where Andre died was real Everything was real until he came back from Terrence Howard house That publisher asked him who do you want to see coming to cut throat city in the beginning He used that to make it More personal in the end and gave it tragic ending He used the pain from his experiences to create that heist ending Graphic novels are supposed to be dark Thats why they all died in the end of the novel nobody would ever know how much of the novel was true because they made Andre death look like car accident So he was really in way memorializing his best friend by putting out the book but yea Dre dead af lol', 'So went back and watched it again and get it now When blink dropped the red colored pencil on the floor while drawing in his sketchbook it showed the heist He was saying this is the route we COULD VE chosen He used that route to complete his Cut Throat City book he started out sketching at the beginning of the movie When the scene was over it showed him drawing some dark red demonic figure This goes back to the Terrence Howard reference earlier in the movie about shedding your wickedness etc etc He changed his life which is why he dropped the other colored pencil guess like the matrix red pill vs blue pill scene This shows he overcame his wickedness and used it to make better life for him and his family So everyone but Andre is still alive Thats why when the lady cop forgot her name stands in front of the yellow wall to talk to him they show her standing in front of red rose It sticking out of policeman shotgun This shows that she changed his life by not completing that sketch So Demetrius Shipp Jr the lightskin guy and blink are all still alive The scene with blink wife and son going to visit blink father is just about mending broken relationships He mentions water trying to make it back from where it once came think that about giving his dad chance to be grandfather because he wasn around to be dad He didn go with them because he

being about the silencing and victim blaming of women in any situation not just SA So if PYM had been about murder and not SA think it would convey message of even in murder the world would not have sympathy for Nina nor would they believe Cassie which believe would still happen think it would be twist that if we thought the movie was about SA and then the edgelords and incels screamed omg more

immediately interested Hope this eventually sees the light of day ', 'I would say Scoob was slightly worse than the Animated Addams Family movie which everyone was much harder on It focused way too much on trying to build up Hanna Barbera cinematic universe and didn really give Fred Daphne or Velma anything interesting to do ', 'Obviously wish this released but hated how Scoob basically dropped that Scooby Doo was always supposed to be scared That and eating were his defining characteristics and they just erased it This having the title holiday haunt made me hopeful it was gonna lean into

come out in theaters ten years ago it could have been classic ', 'Yeah Palm Springs was pretty good for sure personally found it to be clever rather than overly laugh out loud but do agree it was funny and very well executed also believe the internet draws in quality comedy creators rather than movie script writing The only directors have faith in these days are Phil Lord and Chris Miller but

though because it just movie and it was fun ', 'The repetitious day aspect of Palm Springs gets ruined by the previews But just like Groundhog Day the compelling part of the movie isn that mechanism

even post it here but there couldnt be better place to do it you should watch Palm Springs Its worth ', 'I have to list probably have more that arent off the top of my head but these are movies

uplifting ending Damn what movie The Hateful dont know if this is my favorite Tarantino movie but it is sure the one that think about the most dont have any issues with this movie although Im sure there are some valid criticisms people have about it Didnt drag for me amazing mystery unfolding story and intriguing and interesting characters The Nice Guys Who couldve guessed Gosling and Crowe would make one of the best comedy duos probably ever Palm Springs Love Andy Samberg Looking past that this movie appeals to me in so many ways could watch this Palm Springs over and over and never get

me think the director could have fun original take on the body swap trope as well Wish could dazzle you with fancy analysis but dont have the energy for all that Sorry', 'Yeah think wringing something meaningful out of body swap movie is going to be much harder than doing it with groundhog day movie But hey if this guy wants to make his niche be trope movies but where we subvert it by digging deep into the trope to find something human then hey im down for it Palm Springs is probably the best groundhog day movie there is and im huge edge of tomorrow fan ', 'I think the fact that its another

to what he has to do to stay sane and barely does He even tries trapping friend with him but it doesn work in fantastic way think its an interesting difference ', 'It probably the best response especially given what the intended explanation was supposed to be However what interesting is that Palm Springs takes the same concept and makes things compelling by not only explaining things but

new one but loves the old one And that pisses me off Obviously the nee one is better cause ifs actually based on the book And got pissed off about the Artemis Fowl movie for being so bad guess if just depends on if you read the book or not guess But you shouldn tell people to not watch the movie If you read the book then the movie is bad But if you didn read the book then the movie is good Thats how it works ', 'Shes finally getting the recognition she deserves but for years Kathryn Hahn was just flying under the radar being great Shes good in everything but Afternoon Delight is an amazing performance Not sure how most folks feel about Dakota Johnson but her recent roles in The Peanut Butter Falcon Our Friend and The High Note have me convinced shes real talent also think Jason Segels performance in Our Friend is outstanding and hope he gets more roles like that Totally agree about Logan and Maika They need more lead roles ', 'I appreciate your view but have to respectfully disagree with your downplaying comment They didn shy away from showing limbs blown off bloodied corpses trench foot and infections so bad that body parts are falling off men shell shocked and describing their horrible living conditions and lack of adequate food water clothing and shelter What do agree with is the high note at the end It seemed that even after all of this horror that we were just shown the filmakers wanted us to feel cozy and right at home with these soldiers in comfortable conditions that they had spent years away from It honestly made me feel weird which may have been intentional Our discomfort with the amount of normality at the end could be reflective of what the soldiers felt upon returning to stable environment after years of hell It a bit of surreal melancholy feeling though that may just be me thinking too much into it ', 'Alter Bridge Live at the Royal Albert Theater featuring the Parallax Orchestra bought this off Amazon and finally received it Thursday sat down to watch and didnt budge for the entire hours and minutes Its not only an amazingly shot concert but it also has some moments with the band commenting on the process of building show with an orchestra for the first time in their careers Their reactions to hearing their songs with full ensemble behind them is quite awesome to see and hear Obviously if you dont know the band or enjoy their music it wont be great film but as huge Alter Bridge fan this movie concert was everything and so much more could have expected get chills hearing Myles nail THE high note in Words Darker Than Their Wings or hearing the Beatles Blackbird used as the into into AlterBridges own iconic song highly highly recommend if anyone has the chance to do so give this one watch ', 'Sounds amazing and looked fantastic Story was serious letdown need to rewatch it to be sure but so much of the dialogue and story took me out of the universe Snoke death scene was letdown Rey overpowering Jedi master was underwhelming Leia dying then not dying was ridiculous etc etc felt like was watching fans take on what ROTJ should have been but it just never hit the high note that got from TFA Such shame too Definitely worth high points for sound and visuals Easily Shame about that story tho', 'The first of the movie was surprisingly realistic in terms of science and trying to create believable sci fi premise All of the areas where the realism was bent were simply minor patches to accommodate the main thread of the story while keeping it grounded and visually amazing The ending was so gratuitously unnecessary and completely against that that it destroyed what had come before It started as desperate story about world and the human race on the brink of destruction and the struggle to fight the circumstances and human nature preventing their salvation and it ended with BS sappy feel good conclusion that made no physical sense simply so they could have it end on the high note they wanted ', 'I get that the point of it was to show how horrible living in warzone was but film regardless of message should first and foremost be entertaining If your film isn interesting then the message doesn matter think the film Life is Beautiful does much better job of portraying how awful times were even though it a different situation It starts high You see how nice things are and then it goes to hell and gets worse until finally it ends on an emotional high note Now it didn need the high note because happy endings are better than sad ones or some silliness like that It needed it for contrast When everything is just shitty all the time you become desensitized to it and no matter how bad it gets you just stop caring At least that how felt about it guess GOTF moved you which perfectly valid just think it a poor film ', 'I saw this film two days ago at the Tribeca Film Festival My spoiler free review is that it is very OK While the cast and director are obviously amazing it never quite hits the high note that wish it did and that think it able to hit Is it worth seeing Maybe if you re really fan of anyone involved If not wait for the Netflix release ', 'Whatever you do dont watch dangerous lies that just came out Netflix its god horrible the only good thing is the cinematography which is interesting ', ' think it would be that the debt collectors came and kinda beat her think nothing is mentioned about this things but again would think that the movie director wants to show us that the Park Family rich is not in the focus of the movie and we should not worry as much about them as for the other Family poor would say it is intentional that we dont get concrete answers about the Park family Pretty amazing movie ', 'The wrong missy funny witty the lesson it gives is amazing Id like to be someone so free like missy ', 'The Wrong Missy Before you downvote The question was what movie exceeded expectations Last year as we were locking down David Spade comedian like whose films and acting never thought much of Adam Sandler predictable garbage and low intelligence gag affairs thought were all crap including the much loved Danny Boy so any way Spade comes on Howard Stern with the NUMBER ONE GLOBAL MOVIE ON NETFLIX at time when theaters were closed Fluke Anomaly Desperate audience The reviews were horrible What can say spit take worthy laughing on non stop ride with an unknown over the top performance by Lauren Lapkus where the ridiculous character she plays you end up liking defy anyone to not laugh out loud at least dozen times That is winner ', 'Probably the first time Im chuffed by the razzies Lauren Lapkus is amazing and doesnt deserve this know the wrong missy is POS but love the lady ', 'The Wrong Missy was good ', 'I love legion but Midthunder always seemed to be reading from cue cards and her action choreography was horrible But most of that could be on the Legion producers ', 'I am not so optimistic about the Snyder Cut for Justice League since Steppenwolf is horrible villain The problem with the movie was that it felt too much like comic book with the viewer expected to understand the backstories of these heroes unlike Marvel who really fleshed out The Avengers over more than decade Imagine the wonderful Justice League Dark Apokolips War If it was directly made into live action movie it would be pretty bad The tone of comic books cannot be literally translated in live action and be expected to be good ', 'That fine but don force it on the spiderverse cartoons WB and DC should be the ones making this headline Justice League Dark Apokolips War was amazing ', 'All Almodovar work is underrated outside Spanish speaking countries All about my Mother and Bad Education both amazing too ', 'What you call boring call slow burn suspense that builds tension excellently using amazing camerawork an awesome animalistic score and fantastic performances Oh and Bad Education doesn have Anya Taylor Joy which was the entire reason for the recommendation ', 'Its interesting how we perceive it isnt it Youve listed some of my favourite films Actually watched predator and the thing with my kids the other day and loved it Not squeamish at all Maybe its the amazing effects these days that makes me squeamish Although creature features dont freak me out as much as movies human movies mean loved extraction but was wincing every second minute haha am scared to watch bullet train ', 'The actions scenes in the film Extraction with Chris Hemsworth from couple of years ago are amazing ', 'The actions scenes in the film Extraction with Chris Hemsworth are amazing ', 'Some of the scenes in Extraction were amazing ', 'Revised David Short Film by Zach Woods This is on YouTube re release On Team Cocos channel Stars Will Ferrell William Jackson Harper and Fred Hechinger Each of them deliver an amazing performance Its stunning dramatic and comedic Very short but real gem It didnt make me cry but it made me laugh lot especially on second viewing So good super recommend The Willoughbys On Netflix It was constantly being recommended to me but just kept putting it off My sister finally mentioned it was good film so finally watched it Its pretty tight dont think theres really spare moment was never bored or felt like checking the run time Be warned theres bunch of deus ex machinas but enjoyed it really except the narrator is certain famous British comedian who typically enjoy but in this case it was pretty distracting and took me out of the movie bunch Its quirky and fun enjoyed this and it might even be movie would watch again later down the line Its bit predictable and you might find yourself getting frustrated with the main characters for being foolish but you have to remember they are kids There were some surprising parts All in all an enjoyable movie but it didnt bring me to tears If you want to have your kids watch it recommend you watch it first Hopefully they wont be clamoring to become orphans Forgot to mentioned this is an animated film CGI think There are lot of cool yarn elements which is main trope of the film Hope Im using that word right ', 'I just finished watching it right now just made think of something horrible what if in jane voice lol the willoughbys actually froze to death and the ending were they fly at back of commander melanoff is just all imagination that what they always wanted to be adopted maybe they re already in heaven were they all the pain ends and got their perfect family ', 'Since everyone has spoke on pretty much every movie ever just wanted to say feel Karate Kid II has always been my favorite sequel of my personal movie watching The characters STILL have so much to say after the main event amp awards were handed out cant say this enough how amazing Mr Miyagi is to not fight Creese Man with no forgiveness in heart living even worse punishment Second is Back to The Future II amp third Rocky II ', 'As cinematic experience this was amazing Please watch it on IMAX if you can Storywise it was pretty well paced Although it did feel like prologue for the second part which was intended to be the main event so hopefully we get to see that', 'well it certainly seemed that money was well spent The Navi and Sullys looked amazingly realistic They really handled the sense of scale and size differences in scenes with humans and avatars Even the bits of Edie Falco walking around in stilted exo suit with the recombinants and drinking coffee looked great', 'Its an awesome movie that is not talked about more The amount of acting talent on display is amazing Great script and directing You want little coffee with your sugar Im not happy till my spoon is standing straight up', 'Never Rarely Sometimes Always Such an amazing film but its so realistic that it makes you uncomfortable and depressed that dont find myself rewatching it anytime soon ', 'Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping and Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar are relatively recent comedies that were both amazing Minari Nomadland and Never Rarely Sometimes Always were the three best Indies ve seen in while don feel like there has been lot of good sci fi lately the last ones that really got me going were High Life and Annihilation and those were back in ', 'Wow The Hunt is in some amazingly good company there ', 'Trolls World Tour is amazing thats great guess ', 'The Wretched Fantastically average horror movie enjoyed it would recommend to friend but definitely nothing more than one timer lol', 'You don build the avengers of the it just isn going to work in today Gunn is going to come and bring the wretched borderline parody driven plot that is plauging the MCU and ruin the startup of DC What crappy move by WB ', 'Prey Honeymoon Alone The Wretched', 'I feel like great underrated horror thriller was The Wretched never hear it talked about but really enjoyed it', 'Outside of some abrupt animations that broke the effect momentarily agree with you The bar some of the complainers have set is way to high for family affair like this It has Indiana Solo in it so it a must see for me either way but feel m going to legit enjoy taking my family to see this on the big screen Acceptable if not amazing CGI to me Comparing this to the wretched abortion that was Sonic is not even remotely fair or accurate Not every movie needs to have the best everything to be compelling ', 'First cow Slow movie but amazing landscapes and Missy textures and whatnot', 'Check out kelly reichardts movies especially Night Moves and First Cow', 'First Cow was amazing ', 'i view it as comedy noir check out girlfriend day spenser confidential amsterdam an older one really like is hollywood homicide also want to mention assassination of high school president which uses the same high school noir formula as brick but succeeds where brick fails brick should be good and was widely praised but it never totally worked for me because it appeared to take itself too seriously however ll admit the score is amazing ps later loved rian johnson other movies especially looper', 'Daniel Radcliffe still don think he amazing but definitely enjoyed his performances in Imperium and Escape From Pretoria lot more than anything in the Potterverse', 'Jungle and Escape from Pretoria are not comedic like these two but still amazing pieces of work on his half Now you see Me made me giggle because he sucked at magic', 'Hes done some amazing work definitely check out Swiss Army Man Escape from Pretoria and Kill Your Darlings ', 'Man the dialogue in this movie alone is amazing From the rattlesnake waitress the conversation with the banker the ending Such an underappreciated film and one of the best shootouts ever ', 'I love the dinner scene Both in the book and in the Sci Fi miniseries Irulan isnt there in the books In the book theres the amazing dialogue with the smuggler the banker the water seller Dr Kynes and Paul It grounds Paul as character who is teenager raised to hold his own and navigate the politics of rivals who are older and have more experience Paul is not messiah he has been trained from birth to be unnaturally skilled and manipulative ', 'It hasn ever been confirmed but it is highly likely that The Raid is ripoff of Dredd Both films feature an armed law enforcement unit launching an attack on block of flats occupied by violent gang where they get locked inside and have to fight their way to the top floor in order to kill the gangboss Both films also share number of story beats overall pacing and even handful of action scene setups it not just the basic concept that the same The Raid was released in and Dredd but the script for Dredd was actually leaked online all the way back in and it is alleged that the writers of The Raid grabbed copy of it and were very heavily inspired to say the least Both films are amazing and with The Raid focus on martial arts it ends up being different enough from Dredd without feeling like total ripoff though the story similarities can be overlooked ', 'I probably agree if it happened in realistic universe like ours but he Black Bolt King of the Inhumans and has had ton of run ins with characters with otherworldly abilities His death was perhaps my favorite scene in the movie was surprised Marvel went there It wasn bloody but seeing his head smoosh up from the inside and his eyes go bloodshot red was amazing ', 'God Luca is so amazing loved onward but associate it way too much with bad events in my life at the time to ever rewatch it Hell we all were but had stuff happening aside from Covid too Ive rewatched Luca probably times and its just so good and enjoyable Its not their best work its my personal favorite of theirs in years', 'I can see where youre coming from but also Martinet is professional voice actor if he needed to adjust the voice for feature film he absolutely could do it As for Pratt he did AMAZING work in both of The Lego Movies and Onward so think its more he was cast as an iconic role without the range necessary to pull it off as he could for Lego amp Onward ', 'I haven seen new animated movie since onward but the buzz around this one convinced me to finally see another animated movie The animation was amazing and it is one of the coolest looking movies of the year And liked the concept of death with puss facing the value of his life Unfortunately there aren too many scenes of that like the final showdown with puss and death The movie ultimately reminded me of why don watch so many animated films because don really vibe with their style Some of the jokes were so painful and most side characters were just annoying bears the dog have nostalgia for the series and so maybe would have liked it more if was Still decent watch that is supported by its amazing art style', 'Hit the right chord All the Bright Places Elle Fanning is just amazing Fell in love with her acting beauty Can forget her anxiety when she screams for the boy near the lake She learnt to live from boy who wanted to die ', 'Daniel Radcliffe He managed to break out of character that could have defined him forever Hes taken on some amazing eclectic difficult roles Swiss Army Man Guns Akimbo that show how much pure talent he has ', 'I went on Daniel Radcliffe binge and hes done some amazing underappreciated movies amp B Escape from Pretoroia literally amazing and moving true story Guns Akimbo fun exciting film Jungle Another true story with lots of emotion Swiss army man funny weird film', 'My issue is that sometimes get impatient if ve watched couple films in row that didn particularly like or even situation as simple as m watching TV series enjoy and between episodes hear of film want to check out that m not very invested in and that have no real reason to believe its amazing then if it starts off slow might start speeding it up or give up or something like that which know is dumb but idk why do it ig it just feels right at that time which makes me think going back to the example that if d started watching sorcerers apprentice for the first time without knowing what do now about how much d enjoy it then idk if d have found the start interesting unique enough to stick with it Which know sounds really stupid lol but sometimes with films that m just watching casually as opposed to being really interested in like film know is critically acclaimed and my friends love or film in series enjoy that kind of impatience happens example can think of for this is Guns Akimbo film watched recently just cos really liked Samara Weaving in Ready or Not banger of film btw which didn think was good at the end and had that feeling of impatience at lot of times throughout the film which serves me better of the film sucks but also means very much risk missing out on films would have really enjoyed That why sort of wish could find way to know before watching film if d enjoy it lot like d love to watch sorcerers apprentice without having seen it already but knowing that d really enjoy it the way do now so then wouldn get that sort of feeling of slight impatience at all know this all sounds dumb don even really know what my point is lmao m basically wishing could watch whole film and then have the option to erase it from my memory and watch it again if liked it or watch entire films in zero seconds to know if d enjoy it or waste time on it both of which are rather implausible options ', 'I don know what you re talking about Guns Akimbo was an insane and bloody action flick whose story was absolutely perfect for what it was They definitely knew it wasn gonna win any awards but wouldn call it bad movie by any stretch Plus Daniel Radcliffe and Samara Weaving were fucking amazing ', 'I watched Guns Akimbo because wanted to see Rhys Darby Horrible decision really ', 'Endgame has to be mentioned It would have been so easy for that to fall flat on its face The Invisible Man Oh Blumhouse remaking horror classic with modern spin sounded like fine idea turned out amazing Dune had lot of negative expectations working against it So many people were just cautiously optimistic about it ', 'The last film saw in the theaters where it was amazing and the audience was all in was the new remake of the Invisible Man IIRC it came out just before the pandemic hit and we all went into quarantine ', 'Red Son is such an amazing concept but such weak comic Id love to see it get adapted and really fleshed out Doubt itd happen with conservative the US is and how the right thinks democrats are communists already ', 'Red Son would be amazing love that story However also have zero faith that WB DC would ever do it justice ', 'I love the what if stuff Im not big Superman fan but red son was absolutely amazing', 'If Not they will make sometimes SOON and They Make just like in the Comics Teenage mutant ninja Turtles the Last RONIN that will be Amazing of they do that just like Red Son Superman']\n"
