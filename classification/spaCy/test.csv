She was a slut. That's not a technical term obviously but that is what she was. She couldn't say no. There are reports of Arthur Miller catching her in the elevator with an employee. She never got love and needed it badly and she used sex to attempt to get it. I think the only thing close in contemporary media was Anna Nicole Smith, who unfortunately wasn't nearly as bright as Monroe and had a worse outcome.

Another aspect due to the time period is that that sort of blatant sexiness wasn't common. It had a bit of legitimacy that fell away after the mid-60s with low budget nudie flicks ala Russ Meyer. All the women were basically Monroe clones anyway.

 Remaking Die Hard with a school shooting as backdrop is one of the worst ideas for a film I've ever heard of and this film is just as bonkers as I expected.  What I didn't expect was the level of professional polish it has.  The direction by Kyle Rankin is solid work.  The performances, with the exception of that lead school shooter, were strong.  

I didn't like that lead boy because his performance didn't match the established tone.  He seems to be drawing his inspiration from Heath Ledger's Joker and Alan Rickman in Die Hard.  Way too hammy for my tastes.  

Another head-scratching idea was to include Zoey's dead mother as a character to dialogue with.  It didn't work at all for me.  

And, that ending was sickening.  In the end, she becomes just as ruthless as the terrorists.  She finds the Joker kid in a creek and decides to blow a hole through his chest.  She grabs her father's hunting rifle to do it,which recalls the opening scene.  Unlike that scene though, she decides not to finish him and just leaves him to die a slow, agonizing death.   This instantly made her just as corrupt as the shooters and it just turned my stomach.

Batgirl wasn't close to being finished, but it was still far enough in production that it sounded insane that it would be canceled outright.

Anyways.  Both movies that they spent money on that they scrapped.  

And in addition to that, they canceled a lot of DC stuff.  DC has been a heckstorm since Zaslav took over.  I mean it was before he came aboard, but the amount of stuff he pulled the plug on was insane. 

Even further, it seemed like he was wanting to move on from HBO Max branded shows, which made stuff like Harley Quinn and Peacemaker feel vulnerable.  And a show based on a side character in The Batman ... I don't know, it just felt like one of those things that would be canned.

I hung around for a bit and tried to charm my way in just to no avail. I was told I could get into another room around the front for free, so I went around and got in. I got in the room and saw Brody was on stage doing his thing. I had heard Brody  before on some podcasts and I never got him at all and didnt really find him on my wavelength. I ordered a beer and thought I would down it quickly and get back to my girlfriend. Roll on about 90 mins I was on my fifth beers and had tears of laughter running down my cheeks. Brody was still on stage. He delivered one of the funniest sets I have ever scene. He was improvising and bouncing off the crowd. I finally got what all the fuss was about.

He has some nice scenes with Garfield that have some great intensity to them.

I didnt know this was originally written for the stage, but it makes sense. The songs are great and they have that authentic feel that only songs written for live performance have. Ironically, I dont think I went for the ones I was supposed to. The one that hes struggling to write through the first two acts and the one that serves as the big finish were two of my least favorites. My favorite was probably the very first one.

So this is the next good Netflix original. I agree that most of their stuff isnt good, but this year, theyve been averaging about one a month for me that are worth watching.

Blade Runner 2049 - My favorite movie of all time. Everything about it is just perfect imo. It elevates and pays tribute to the first installment while standing om its own. Gosling kills it, Ana de Armans and Ford are fantastic. My favorite visuals in a movie, one of my favorite stories of all time, plus it delivers on the emotions with a satisfying and sad yet also uplifting ending.
Damn, what a movie.

The Hateful 8 - I dont know if this is my favorite Tarantino movie, but it is sure the one that I think about the most. I dont have any issues with this movie although Im sure there are some valid criticisms people have about it. Didnt drag for me amazing mystery/unfolding story, and intriguing and interesting characters.

The Nice Guys - Who couldve guessed Gosling and Crowe would make one of the best comedy duos probably ever?

Palm Springs - Love Andy Samberg. Looking past that, this movie appeals to me in so many ways. I could watch this Palm Springs over and over and never get tired of it. Plus a fantastic little cameo role for JK Simmons.

Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse - The perfect Spidey movie that was somehow made by the company that made the emoji movie.

Megamind - Probably my favorite animated movie. Funny as hell while putting a nice twist on superhero movies. Chefs kiss",1.0,1.0,1,1.0

What happens if I dont become a famous writer or dont publish more books, or dont affect more ripples in the world than I have until now? Will life still be worth living? Is doing a little job and forging a little family and living out this little life, with short vacations in the city, and big and small heartbreaks and joys, worth it? The movie answered the question for me. 

There is a line from a regional Indian movie that stuck with me and got pulled back up into my mind after I watched it. The movie is of a man who is known for perennially fixing things for others, an under-rated scatterbrained commoner who everybody loves for being there for them in his little town, often at the expense of his own challenges. In the movie, a woman asks the protagonist why he's okay running around for other people often, even if it means he might not be as successful as he could be if he was singularly focused on making just his dreams come true. And he says, with a wry smile, how in the game of Lemon and Spoon, the aim is not to reach the finish line as soon as possible. The aim is to make sure that your lemon is well within your spoon till the end. In life, your big and small dreams may not come true, what you foresaw life to mean and be, the big picture, might not always materialize, but at the end of the day, if your lemon is within your spoon - if the people you love and cherish are by your side, no matter your level or definition of accomplishment - then you're lucky. That's his definition of victory. 

I am surrounded by a large loving bunch of family and friends at all times, but I often fight bouts of feeling like I don't bring much to the table, that I don't deserve good company, and that I'm too small to live out this big life. But the fact that Evelyn could have had any of those lives where she was magnificent and successful and talented and where her daughter could have been anything else brought tears to my eyes. Maybe if a day comes, when my mother and father and sister, and the horde of loving friends that has stuck around despite everything else, were given the same choice; do you want a life where I could be something else, something better, would you take her or would you stick with the same daughter/friend/sister, maybe they'd say that they wanted me.

But creating a movie, in which a modern day, slave worked plantation exists, is beyond ridiculous. Its nothing but woke liberal psycho babble horse shit. It would never exist, in modern times and making an entire movie based on that total fabrication is nothing but pure propaganda. 

You comparing it to making a movie about the Holocaust is nowhere near an accurate comparison and extremely insensitive. This trash movie was made in the current time and Ive never seen a movie about the Holocaust, that didnt take place in the years of which the Holocaust took place. 

So, you see, that is the issue with this woke trash and its just another one of the fifty movies that have come out, in the past couple years that focus on white peoples bad and black peoples courageous and heroic. Everyone is sick and tired of this same subject matter being pushed and promoted in everything from movies, advertising, sports and the list got on. Its like our society just cant focus on the now and has to just constantly make the sad attempt to act like racism is stronger than ever. Its just not true and continuing to promote it, is unproductive and results in further division. 

A little unity would be nice and admitting that racism is not consuming our country would be a great direction to go. Racism is not some HUGE issue, plaguing modern day America. Equality exists and everyone is given the same opportunities, if they are willing to work hard and be an honest/productive member of society. 

Do you here Jewish people criticizing and blaming current day Germany for the Holocaust?  No, of course you dont, because that would be absurd.  Dont you find it interesting that something as tragic as the Holocaust, is not held over the head of modern day Germany but slavery in America, is still largely blamed on modern day white people in America?  To be honest, both times in history were horrible and shouldve never happened but keeping alive the lie that white people of today should feel responsible or accountable is pure insanity and fantasy. Just like you would never tell a modern day Germany that they are at fault for the Holocaust. 

If youd like to share with us a modern day movie that depicts Germans as current Day Holocaust members, Id love to check that movie out.  I will wait, with the crickets and tumbleweeds because we both know, no such movie exists.  And it will never exist because its completely insensitive to German people and paints them in a picture that is completely unfair.

even when things didnt work out, howie always saw an angle to play. and in the end i think he had resolved to dying the second he decided not to call up his girlfriend to call off the bet. he planned it to be his final noble act of sacrifice to try and make up for a lifetime of fucking people over. it was probably the first time he has felt loved by anyone in a long time and was okay with dying as long as she had the money. so kind of a redemption i guess.

and the mob guy didnt give a fuck about the money. he plays by different rules and howie crossed the line by gambling money that wasnt his to gamble and the doors. the 2 thugs wont be able to get out with the jewellery anyways without knowing about the broken mechanism. also, the people in the building definitely heard 2 shots... so it is what it is.

I will even go as far as to say that was better than the first one and I love the original. The romance between K and Joi was miles better than Deckard and Rachel's; that sex scene/ foreplay was the most captivating (and sexy) thing I've seen in a movie this year. The character development in general was handled better than the first one. Ana for instance is only in one scene and you learn so much about her through dialogue and visuals (knowing about her past, the birthday cake is depressing). And the score, while playing off of the first one, expanded on the original and created this unsettling but also hypnotic tone. 
 
Edit: Listening to the soundtrack, the track ""Wallace"" is the perfect example of unsettling and beautiful. It also goes well with the titular character's elusiveness and he's egotistical/ self-importance; he believes himself to be God (which he kind of is) and the track reflects this with the Tuvan throat singing (or what appears to sound like it) which give this image of worship and deity.

1366,"I think it does a good job of explaining it in layman terms for people not that technology savvy. When most people think AI they think along the lines of the Terminator and androids, which makes it seem like this far future thing, not something that we already have and is already affecting our daily lives. The immediate danger of AI isn't that it will become sentient, it is more that it isn't sentient (in that it can't think or analyse more abstract human ideas). Via recommendation AIs we have a world being heavily affected, minute by minute, by something that doesn't understand or take into account the consequences of it's actions.

It does sensationalise it a bit in the cringey dramatisations, but then social media has helped create a world where most people will only pay attention to sensationalised information.

The ultimate takeaway I got from the social dilemma wasn't that Facebook and Twitter etc are evil companies hellbent on rigging elections and turning people into hate machines (morally bankrupt yes, but it is a lot easier to make those decisions when you are massively detached from the people they will affect, or don't really understand the affects it will have). More that they are incompetent and are using technology they can't really control (most AIs are black box when it comes to how they made a specific decision, we can see the data but it rarely makes sense to a human) and refuse to put it back in the box because they have to keep making higher and higher profits to please shareholders. Which also explains why efforts to curb the spread of fake news has mostly been manual, how do you teach an AI what truth is? As good as they are at working towards a scorable goal they still don't think, they can't critically analyse what they recommend. They recommend fake news because they don't know the difference, people are more likely to read sensationalised headlines and fake news tends to be more sentionalized.

In all my work that is centered in cultures not my own, I hope that comes through because that is incredibly important to me.

In the promotion and PR thats what theyve been emphasizing. So they over promised and underdelivered.

Should I have ignored the PR? Sure. But I didnt. I went into the film with that mindset.

Can I forget about it and suspend my disbelief? Sure.

In the end, I am disappointed, because it had a lot of potential for being a good remake or a good reimagining and it was neither.

The cultural appropriation is insult to injury. Lots of things in the movie that makes people familiar with the culture scratch their head.

Cinema has a history of exploiting culture for its foreign exoticism. And in 2020, Disney is still did it with Mulan.

Culture. Mythology. History. Etc.

1395,"The Broken Hearts Gallery is a romantic comedy, which can be a dirty term to some. Understandably so, as there are plenty of stinkers out there under the 'romcom' banner. This however isn't one of those, no this is a charming and impressive directorial debut by Natalie Krinksy. It is genuinely funny and filled with numerous laugh out loud moments. It's witty and intelligent and portrays a world that's easy to get engrossed in, as it's populated by a cast of bright and diverse characters who are easy to love.

There is plenty to admire and enjoy here, particularly when acknowledging it's a debut effort. But given few things in cinema are perfect, there are a few (mostly minor) negatives to acknowledge so let's do that first. Whilst the soundtrack of the film is inoffensive and there's nothing egregiously wrong with it, I'm also personally not the biggest fan of mass produced modern pop and it did feel moderately out of place on a few occasions. Whilst by no means frequent, there are also moments when the dialogue feels somewhat sloppy. Occasionally feeling stilted, and in a few moments somewhat cheesy. However this is far from the norm and on the whole The Broken Hearts Gallery is excellently written, managing dialogue that feels at once grounded and real whilst retaining some stylised and elevated elements. Plus aside from anything else, the comedic beats in the film are largely hilarious, frequent and well timed. The only other criticism worth noting, is that the film does occasionally lose focus leading to infrequent moments of messiness. These briefly pose the question of where we're going or the exact purpose of a couple of scenes. This isn't a major detractor or common across the film's runtime, the vast majority of which is slickly and stylishly directed whilst always retaining its aforementioned charm and heart.

It is that all encompassing charm that carries this, When Harry Met Sally for the hipster age a very long way. Whilst I don't think TBHG is quite on the level of the great Rob Reiner movie, that is hardly surprising given WHMS is the gold standard for romance based comedy. This film certainly owes a debt of gratitude to WHMS and has echoes of its DNA, most plainly emphasised by its cute social media styled intermediate video vignettes which break up the film; much in the same way as our check ins with friendly elderly couples in WHMS, just in an updated format. By no means should my comparisons between the two movies be seen as a criticism or diminishing what has been created here, quite the opposite in fact I mean to pay both TBHG and Natalie Krinsky a sincere compliment. Certainly the film stands on its own two feet with confidence, and possesses several unique elements with which Krinsky makes the film her own.

One of these unique elements that gives the film its own flavour, are the stylised and superbly choreographed breaks in the film's traditional storytelling. Best exemplified by a sweet moment in the first act, when our main character Lucy is comforted after a typical romcom bad break up. Said moment is filmed in an immaculately choreographed and stylish series of slowed down shots, which serves to accentuate the moment. There are several of these choreographed moments, they're fun, whimsical and visually splendid. They give the film, which moves at an otherwise brisk pace, a chance to breathe.

We are of course retreading some familiar ground here in places, which I feel rather goes with the territory. I fear romantic comedy is one of the genres that is rather challenging to totally innovate within. All your classic elements can be found here, bad break ups, a typical 'will they, won't they' dynamic, scenes of our love interests in separate locations but rushing to meet one another, grand gestures (which are acknowledged within the film in a tongue in cheek, self aware fashion) and big romantic monologues. Despite this it does retain a feeling of freshness, and despite being predictable that's no bad thing and it never feels cliched.

The cinematography on display was a nice highlight. It's not standard or stale, which goes a long way to giving it a visual identity. Shot in a warm, rich and neony (totally a word!) colour palette, it feels cosy and suits the movie's tone to a tee. There are numerous shots taken from interesting angles, and some shot at non-standard speeds. The shot selection and visual language, which Krinsky and cinematographer Alar Kivilo have created is impressive and polished. 

All that is good and enjoyable here is best encapsulated and personified, by TBHG's wonderful cast of which there are no weak links. Geraldine Viswanathan (as Lucy) and Dacre Montgomery (as Nick) are both incredibly endearing, putting in electric performances in the lead roles. Viswanathan in particular is equal parts smart, charming, funny and fierce, a powerful and independent woman and wonderful to see in this kind of film. Honourable mentions also go to Molly Gordon (as Amanda) and Phillipa Soo (as Nadine), who bring an edge and some dark humour to their supporting roles which is most pleasing. Arturo Castro too is funny and disarming in his role as Nick's best friend Marcos. There is an easy and joyous camaraderie between everyone on screen together for much of the movie. Bernadette Peters is pitch perfect casting as pretentious and glamorous gallery owner Eva Woolf. Not forgetting to mention Nathan Dale as Jeff, who has a quietly humorous build up to his character throughout the movie and who's pay off is one of the funniest gags in the whole film.

So in short, I would highly go recommend anyone to go and see this provided it is safe in your location to visit the cinema. To support a talented filmmaker's debut and just to have a much needed, feel good fun time. It's well written, sharply paced and has a talented and hilarious cast. The cinematic needs more efforts like this, films which pay homage to and have classic cinema's DNA but do something uniquely their own with it.

I like the film ending more. The book ends (from the average persons point of view) with a god (Manhattan) abandoning them while an existential threat looms. The movie ends with a god abandoning them AND becoming the existential threat. 

Both are similar but there is a nuance to it that I like to think on. I kind of like the book version better overall because it is just a pure sense of dread and loss competing for your emotions. The movie version ends on pure paranoia as the godly overpowered figure suddenly seems to have turned on us. 

Both outcomes will get the world to come together and stop fighting, but I feel like having people think Manhattan is after them would give everyone a profound sense of revenge because he used to be with us.

 They should have had a few more scenes of him being bullied or abused or slowly developing more of a hate for humanity or those how saw him as weak or crippled. Matt Smith was enjoyable to watch as a bad guy just running amok doing whatever he wanted.
 
 The movie wasn't terrible, I've seen far worse. So what's the deal here?

I really liked the first movie, third movie and for me the revolution begin with fifth, sixth, seventh movie, where I became a fan. I simply loved director's effort of Justin Lin, James Wan and F. Gary Gray. Those were NAMES. I also like side-characters and their actors like - Kurt Russel, Scott Eastwood, Jason Statham, The Rock (possibly his best role), Luke Evans or Tony Jaa. But something tells me, that they should've stop after the eight one. That was the biggest peak. 

I also really enjoy Hobbs and Shaw, which reminds me a lot a movies like Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour. It was a really good movie, with also fantastic cast. Vanessa Kirby, Hellen Mirren, Idris Elba, Eiza Gonzales (and her scenes!!). Like a proper action flick. 

But from the moment F9 was announce I just felt that this isn't right. Justin Lin didn't succeed with Star Trek: Beyond (he killed that franchise) and coming back with a sterile film. This series did many thing wrong and crazy, impossible at least. But - they didn't ,,reviving characters just like that"". What they did with Han completely destroys this franchise for good. Leaving all the side characters outside was another ,,misstep"". And Vin Diesel as the only hero of this franchise is just ,,wrong"". The only replacement for Paul Walker should be Scott Eastwood or at least Statham maybe even The Rock. Not the melodrama between Vin and Michelle. And now, even Justin is gone and some no-name director directs the finale of the franchise. So sad. I really like the franchise to the eight entry. Now I cannot see it.

When the scene was over it showed him drawing some dark red demonic figure. This goes back to the Terrence Howard reference earlier in the movie about shedding your wickedness etc etc. He changed his life, which is why he dropped the other colored pencil (i guess like the matrix red pill vs blue pill scene). This shows he overcame his wickedness and used it to make a better life for him and his family. So everyone but Andre is still alive. Thats why when the lady cop (i forgot her name) stands in front of the yellow wall to talk to him they show her standing in front of a red rose. It's sticking out of a policeman's shotgun. This shows that she changed his life by not ""completing that sketch."" So Demetrius Shipp Jr, the lightskin guy, and blink are all still alive.

In Aladdin for example, when Jasmine is in the Market. In the original the guy was threatening to cut off her hand for stealing. A stereotypical, but very real thing during that time period on that area of the world. This created a very real and emotional motive for Aladdin to jump in and risk his life to save her hand. 

In the remake the guy just threatens to take her necklace/jewelry as payment. Like...yeah you should pay for what you stole. Maybe he was taking more than what the apple was worth, but it didn't seem nearly as big of a deal. 

In an effort to diminish a stereotype, they watered down that scene and many other scenes in this movie and others. 

In the original Mulan, the fact Mulan was a woman meant her place in Chinese society was as a wife/homemaker. She was a very strong character with motivations to save her family and struggles in her military training to uphold her family honor and save her father. There was a multifaceted motivation for what she was doing and a lot of societal subtext about a woman's role in their society. 

The Mulan remake lacked any subtext. It was all in your face and ""she's a woman she can't do that."" They also made her character kind of a Mary Sue stereotype was was good at everything she did and still looked down upon robbing her character of agency and the actual struggles of her decisions. Mulan on the live action remake was this amazing warrior woman who didn't struggle in battle at all which diminishes her character entirely. Mulan in the original didn't want to go to war, but did it to save her father. Mulan in the remake was like ""I'm the best warrior on the planet I want to go to war.""",0.0,0.0,0,

1589,"I think what makes the ""anti-hero"" ""make the villain the protagonist"" live action remakes works so well is because it does something a million times better than the original animated versions: actual depth of character and motives and actions that makes sense. A lot of the female villains in the original films were in my opinion a little shallow; they seemed to be evil for the sake of being evil and their motives seem more like excuses rather than actual reasons for their villiainry. For example: Maleficent. Cursing a baby just because her parents did not invite her to the christening? Very unfair and makes little sense (for our human brain at least). Cursing a baby because her father is a genocidal arsehole who has betrayed her and tailoring the curse as an echo to the the betrayal? Makes a lot more sense. Similarly, with Cruella, we get an actual explanation as to why she is not a 'nice' person. 

By this hypothesis, a good film to remake then would be The Little Mermaid but from Ursula's perspective. The reason why she was banished from the palace was never revealed in the films proper and it would be nice to see the events leading up to that. According to the stage musical, Ursula was supposed to rule the seas with King Triton but he eventually banished her because she used dark magic and was greedy. Well...what if that was wrong? What if the reason why Ursula was so keen to take back the throne was because she was the rightful ruler (or at least co ruler) of the sea and Triton kicked her out so he can have the kingdom for himself? There could be a subplot in which Ariel finds out that Ursula was the true Queen of the Sea and both help each other get what they want.

1653,"So, what the Jungle Book did that a lot of reboots havent done is it kinda fixed one of the complaints about animated Jungle Book, which was a lack of over all plot. The animated movies is just Mowgli wandering around the jungle. I would also argue that Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, and Pete and the Magic Dragon were also transformative enough to be decent movies, if not great. Lady and the Tramp is also mildly remarkable for its canine stars being shelter dogs trained for most of the stunts with cgi to make their faces more expressive, Same goes for Cruella and Maleficent, both of which were kinda silly but they were new perspectives on old stories.

Starting around Beauty and the Beast reboot, they basically did color-by-number recreations, but usually with un-added flourishes added, most of those flourishes being crowdsourced from decades of internet nit-picks and theories. So it feels unoriginal, and made to address nit-picks, theories, and quibbles that middle the focus. Add fluff piece articles to make much ado of minimal strides towards representation (We made LaFou gay!!!) as cheap publicity, making Disney look desperate for even a scrap of good press. Mulan, while largely transformative, was made absolutely wrongheadedly, and was one of the three strikes that made China stop taking Disneys movies (which might actually be best in the long run).

Some of these movies might have been salvageable if they had simply not tried to recapture the magic of the animated movies. Aladdin as essentially Hitch 2 but with magic would been easy money. Lion King as Shakespeare told through a nature documentary, complete with a narrator as Greek Chorus, would be interesting, and justify them adhering to photorealistic portrayals of the characters. If they had simply let Donnie Yen direct Mulan I guarantee it would at least be as fun to watch as a middling action movie with more than a few good action scenes.

This film has it's plot (a woman and her friends get trapped underground with a race of cannibal monsters) and it's subtext (a woman is traumatised by a tragedy and has to rediscover her self.) 

The subtext is driven home by some incredible imagery. Namely, the shot of her daughter holding a birthday cake which appears at key moments throughout. After they become trapped with the monsters, the shot appears again but with the monsters screaming face over her daughter's face.

The symbolism is clear. Her trauma over the loss of her daughter is now being projected externally on the very real monsters and immediate terror. By dealing with the monsters she is dealing with her trauma.

This all comes to a head when she goes to the lowest depths and discovers the dark secret at the heart of the trauma. That her best friend was having an affair with her husband. She then becomes a monster herself.

At the end, she takes revenge on her real enemy (Juno) by leaving her to die. She dreams of escape because this is the subtext. She has found release from her trauma. When we cut back to the cave, this is made explicit by showing her with her daughter and the birthday cake, finally reunited in her mind.

I agree with Tom Cruise, hes usually good at picking gold projects and the movies are solid and worth watching

Id say Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio. If you look at Matt Damon and ignore his cameos in movies and the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot he was in for his friend Kevin Smith he doesnt really have a bad film going back 11+ years; The Adjustment Bureau, Contagion, We Bought a Zoo, Elysium, The Martian, Interstellar, Jason Bourne, Ford V Ferrari, Stillwater, The Last Duel, he really does a good job avoiding being in awful films 

Leo is the same way, if you look at his last movies starring in its nuts; Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, The Revenant, The Wolf of Wall Street, The Great Gatsby, Django, J Edgar (mid but not bad), Inception, Shutter Island, like going so long without attaching yourself to a truly bad movie is such a skill a lot of actors and actresses do not have",0.0,0.0,0,
1814,"For me, it really depends on the type of film I'm considering. If it's a light, popcorn film and I just want to know how entertaining it might be, I check out someone like Jeremy Jahns who is not a critic but just a regular person with a big audience. If it's a prestige film or a heavy-hitting indie darling, I'm more interested in hearing from critics who have a wealth and breadth of knowledge and experience like the critics from Breakfast All Day or Mark Kermode or the people who run Indiewire's Film Talk podcast or in the past, the Av Club's film reviews because they are looking to dig deep and analyze a film and they can recognize homages or references that I, as a more recent film fan, just can't. 

It also depends on if a film speaks to a particular experience. I recently watched The Boys in the Band and I really enjoyed it but I'm not a gay man or even in the LGBTQ+ community. I also had no idea about the storied history of the play or the previous film or any of that so I checked out the Pop Culture Happy Hour episode about it (which had four critics who all happen to be gay men) as well as listening to the Breakfast All Day episode since one of those critics is an older gay man who had significant knowledge about the original film and the play, etc. It's not that other critics can't or shouldn't have opinions about these films but I'm always curious to see if films like this resonate with the groups of people they are attempting to portray. Do they feel authentic or stereotypical, real or dated and hackneyed? 

While it's true that critics can generally give you an idea if something is worth seeing, I feel that their real aim is approaching a film from the lens of film canon.

But that will make him a good president because he knows what it's like to not come from the elite. 

When Malcolm gets angry at her for it, ghe whole family (whilst covered in that gunk from Reece's septic tank prank) all agree with Lois. And Lois challenges Malcolm to tell her he couldn't be president. He can't because he knows she right. Hal even makes a joke about Malcolm not getting the easy ride through life but Dewey will.

The bittersweet ending to Malcolm in the Middle follows the trend of all episodes ending in a slight negative in terms of outcome for Malcolm. It's also more believable than a magic mcguffin job offer at the end of the series. With the final shot being him putting away a mop bucket and running off to his college classes with the same song from the first episode playing in the background.
