I watched that documentary ""The Most Beautiful Boy in The World"" all about Bjorn. It's quite informative on the whole story. It's a fantastic watch, I would highly recommend everyone to watch it. Before Bjorn visited Japan he used to receive thousands of fan mail letters from Japanese fans. Then when he visited there it was like Beatlemania.. everywhere he went there were mass crowds trying to touch him or with scissors trying to clip a lock of his hair, huge signs everywhere saying ""Welcome to Japan, Bjorn!"".I believe the film's success and influence in Japan is somewhat understated in the West. His popularity, as result of the film, was capitalised in many ways in Japan such as advertising and indeed a successful pop singing career (He sang in Japanese, a language completely unknown to him! I found this very impressive!)There was an Manga artist, Ryoka Ikeda, I think she authored The Rose of Versailles. She said the character, a beautiful female dressing and acting as a man, was directly influenced by Bjorn Andresen. She also spoke of how there was a change in manga circles around that time due to the film, and how much of an influence Bjorn was on manga and anime of today, specifically the typical white, blonde, effeminate male characters widely seen in some manga genres.",13/9/2021 3:40,1,1,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

Im very much reminded of last years The Green Knight and its commentary on Masculinity. Both films seem to torture the protagonist and ridicule his inability to wield a weapon effectively, making note of their phallic characteristics. Both films have awkward cum scenes as well. In the Green Knight, its Ser Gawains sword, and in this film, it transitions from a gun to a dagger weapons that were more effectively wielded by other characters in Infinity Pool (especially the Croatian Kids natural affinity for penetration with sharp objects). Although it will take some days for this film to really stew in my mind, Im unsure what the film wants to say about Masculinity Gabi (Mia Goth) is in full control of James Fosters life from the word go. She makes a note of the need for men like him to Realize how strong they actually are, shedding the submissive and deferent nature asked of by women like Em. Much like James, (at least the male audience) are seducted into adopting her philosophy this is an attractive, ideal woman saying this, after all (keep in mind her profession deals with advertising). Your first impression is to take her at her word, fully imparting your trust into her (notice her parlor trick involves a knife at the Chinese restaurant scene). Over the films course, we can observe that Gabi has let out her shadow and fully expressed her more grotesque inner self domineering, contemptuous, and impossible to please. Could the film be suggesting that perhaps the pursuit of idealized types is an inherently destructive act? Em is a Rich Girl the way Hall and Oates would suggest yet she seemed supportive of James Foster up to a fault- would she have unraveled in a similar fashion as Gabi had she stuck around? Im reluctant to accept that James Foster has seized control of his own destiny. His transformation by blood has left him stunted and practically mute in public. The rainy season arrives, and all James can do is sit, unable to enjoy the purifying effects of falling rain, the classic literary signal of rebirth. TLDR: enjoy it if youre on your own, but maybe dont bring a date to this one.",27/1/2023 5:47,,,,SUBJECTIVE,NEGATIVE

Ill admit that I liked the film, but I dont like it enough where its considered to be the best film or anything as the whole film itself just feels rather lacklustre and bland as it leaves a poor aftertaste on your mouth.The plot itself was kinda alright, but the worst offenders for the film was the middle and the end as I feel like it couldve been so much better if they just did it right. In the middle of the film where LeBron James and Bugs Bunny set out to go around the in-servers Serververse to retrieve the missing Looney Tunes cast, I was looking forward to see the fun little antics and mischief that they were going to get themselves into. But when I saw that it became one of those musical montages after getting Daffy Duck from DC Superheroes, I just loathed at how the other lesser-known characters just literally popped into the scene with LeBron without any context, and I hated that.As for the end, both LeBron and Dom eventually learned how his virtual basketball game contained a very serious bug that required someone to perform a specific move set that was inspired from LeBrons basketball skills where the game itself would literally crash and blue screen as seen earlier on the film when Don was building and showing his father his game. While that I liked the callback of seeing how something from the beginning ended up being relevant and play a crucial role later on in the film, the execution itself was just terrible. For me, I was expecting Al.G-Rithm (yes, thats his name) to perform the glitchy move and cause the whole server to just end up glitching and break apart while the whole crowd just disconnects as their summoned connection to the Serververse would be terminated while LeBron runs to the basketball and performs a final dunk to allow them to win the game. But instead, Bugs Bunny performs the glitchy move, everyone functions as normal, a slow motion scene comes into play with how LeBron is being tackled by Al.G before Dom intervenes and throws a jump boost power-up at LeBron to help him slam dunk while Al.G gets posterised and his little digital minion bursting through the poster a few minutes later to celebrate the victory and delete him. And as for Bugs Bunny who was seen to be unwell and being all glitchy, hes fine as he always uses the whole Im a toon logic of him being able to survive through anything, even if it means risking himself to perform the glitchy move.If the producers spent some more time to refine the movie, especially with the middle and the end, then it would be somewhat better rather than just slapping in a rushed musical montage to skip through it. But alas, I just find it to be a disappointment in the end. Oh, and the whole movie was quite packed with all sorts of cameos and other IPs of Warner Bros like Gremlins, Harry Potter, Superman, etc., which took away the charm that previous live Looney Tunes movies had before",17/12/2022 19:49,,,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

Didn't get to watch much of the original Rescue Rangers but I did enjoy some of the episodes. I was skeptical because of how recent Disney films have been lacking and how full of themselves they had become with their movies. But I like Samberg so I gave it a chance. I really didn't like it.The animation is trying to be 2D like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" with the touch of live-action but it honestly looks like garbage. There are moments where there are animation errors and it seemingly looks really ugly. The color palette seems to not match the backgrounds at many moments as if the animation was unfinished. None of the new characters were interesting at all as they felt underwritten, annoying, or just unnecessary to be in. As much as I love most of the cast, the voice acting is completely off-putting and really annoying. Samberg and Mulvany are great comedians but as a duo, I wasn't a big fan of it as it made my ears almost bleed. The dialogue is very clunky and really bad. I almost feel like I am watching a Dhar Mann film.The meta-commentary is trying to play hard with many of its references like making fun of the ugly sonic design, the movie Cats, the Robert Zeckemis Stop motion era, and many other properties. But as the meta continues, it honestly feels like the writers and directors were just trying to jerk themselves off and be like ""See? I am making fun of the other properties because I know more than they do! So I'm smarter and funnier than you"" kind of feel. As if it's like the kid who desperately tries to be in the group and acts all cool to impress people. It's not good meta but just bad and desperate attempts of being meta. Criticizing how ugly the movie Cats look yet Chip n Dale's designs look ugly and very creepy seems ironic I assume. What they did to the character of Peter Pan was shocking and knowing what happened to the original voice actor who suffered from alcoholism, honestly, that's a bit of a stretch. Such I laugh at that? Maybe, but I didn't. As if Disney couldn't help themselves.The best part is that the soundtrack fits well and there are some nice colors demonstrated in the film. It's bad. At least there was more passion than Space Jam: A New Legacy. But I rather watch Neil Breen.People will love this movie as I haven't seen many negative opinions and mostly positive opinions.

The Forever Purge is an interesting concept but I'd rather have seen this movie against the government creators of the Purge.

The preceding movies put more and more focus on the social themes the series was trying to convey until my pick for best in the franchiseThe First Purgeopenly states that the Purge is used by government officials as a means of class and ethnic control.The Forever Purgeimagines what happens when that kind of idealogue escapes its way into the general population.Focusing on two Mexican immigrants, the story quickly pushes into their first Purge night as Americans settling an awful lot of time on a convoy of armored trucks driving around and purging all of the ""non Americans"" they come across (hint: non-whites) that certainly isn't ham-fisted foreshadowing. The Purge ends in the morning and they all return back to their lives.Or do they?Quickly it is revealed that the Purge is in fact not over, and perhaps it never will be, as the Purgers reveal they don't plan to ever stop purging. One of the purgers who properly kick starts the movie reveals that he's doing it out of some nihilistic leftist view of destroying exploitation and wage slavery, displaying that all of the people senselessly butchering others in the streets aren't all an implausibly large group of white supremacists able to defeat the military rolling in to establish order. The real root cause is the rage that American society breeds and the fetishization of violence that comes with it. One of the subtleties the movie does get across quite well. Most Americans have very vague and nebulous political beliefs. Murder and anger are the true beliefs prevalent in America.On a technical level, this movie does impress more than a lot ofPurgemovies. There's an impressive long take featuring a tank that is engaging. The characters are a little more fleshed out than otherPurgemovies including a fairly obvious but still satisfying redemption arc. Sometimes the movie falls back into the series' worst elements (an incredibly cringe inducing monologue by a Nazi with a swastika on his cheek, a cool one-liner near the end that made me groan), but still it never dipped too low where it pulled me out of what was going on.This movie has a lot to say, even if a lot of it is surface level and obvious, but I will give it props for actually having something meaningful and heavy to say, especially for a Hollywood franchise. Brutally nihilistic, incredibly gory, and very in your face,The Forever Purgecaptures a good amount of what a lot of people feel about the future of America, while also being a decent action/horror movie to boot.",2/7/2021 5:04,1,1,,SUBJECTIVE,NEGATIVE

As a nobody trying to be an actor, I have noticed that the overwhelming majority of things I see casting calls for now skew LGBTQ or ethnically based. Which is great but another caveat is now the majority of calls are looking for people who are legitimately what the brief is looking for... Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of acting.. So ya, from what I see both on screen and in the call sheets it is def trending towards LGBTQ. Which to pick up on the point above I don't feal there doing a good job off even. Recent example, and I know it's a kids flick, the main love story in fear street 1994 was horrific. If the lead lady was a Lead guy her actions would be considered highly disturbing.

The most concerning news is F9 had a 70% drop in its second week, which is becoming a very common result this year with theatrical movies. Also Boss Baby 2 did the best it could with the massive obstacles it's up against and a major warning for kids/family films since children are still unvaccinated and the looming danger of the Delta Variant. An additional side note that most likely factored in less tickets sales is streaming had a massive Fourth of July weekend. Offering a lot of movies on various demographics with Tomorrow War grabbing the action oriented audiences, Fear Street 1994 for the horror audience, No Sudden Move for the crime thriller audience, and Boss Baby 2 had a day and date release for the kids/family audience.

I had high expectations due to everyone being involved with this film and their past work. It far exceeded my expectations. I will even go as far as to say that was better than the first one and I love the original. The romance between K and Joi was miles better than Deckard and Rachel's that sex scene/ foreplay was the most captivating (and sexy) thing I've seen in a movie this year. The character development in general was handled better than the first one. Ana for instance is only in one scene and you learn so much about her through dialogue and visuals (knowing about her past, the birthday cake is depressing). And the score, while playing off of the first one, expanded on the original and created this unsettling but also hypnotic tone.  Edit: Listening to the soundtrack, the track ""Wallace"" is the perfect example of unsettling and beautiful. It also goes well with the titular character's elusiveness and he's egotistical/ self-importance he believes himself to be God (which he kind of is) and the track reflects this with the Tuvan throat singing (or what appears to sound like it) which give this image of worship and deity.

This film has it's plot (a woman and her friends get trapped underground with a race of cannibal monsters) and it's subtext (a woman is traumatised by a tragedy and has to rediscover her self.) The subtext is driven home by some incredible imagery. Namely, the shot of her daughter holding a birthday cake which appears at key moments throughout. After they become trapped with the monsters, the shot appears again but with the monsters screaming face over her daughter's face.The symbolism is clear. Her trauma over the loss of her daughter is now being projected externally on the very real monsters and immediate terror. By dealing with the monsters she is dealing with her trauma.This all comes to a head when she goes to the lowest depths and discovers the dark secret at the heart of the trauma. That her best friend was having an affair with her husband. She then becomes a monster herself.At the end, she takes revenge on her real enemy (Juno) by leaving her to die. She dreams of escape because this is the subtext. She has found release from her trauma. When we cut back to the cave, this is made explicit by showing her with her daughter and the birthday cake, finally reunited in her mind.It is the epitome of a bittersweet ending. Lost in reality, but at peace and finally made whole on the inside.",11/6/2016 20:39,1,1,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

Spoilers ahead:In the first dialog while interrogating we learn the Dror was ""seen by a girl"" which is why they suspect him.  This is never mentioned again.  When released from van, he hangs bike on the wall (which is really the door to the secret room which we as the viewer are unaware of.)  They find the headless body, dad shows up blah blah your standard fare movie stuff.  Fast forward, the cop is taking Dror again, cop gets call to make sure he gets daughter.  This is a pivotal scene.  We see Dror take a plastic bag (which i believe has the head in it), throw it away across the street, then help and old lady back.  We are distracted from this because the cop makes a comment about who helps old ladies still.  But before we can process what we saw, now we are introduced to the father of the murdered girl trailing both the cop and Dror.  We see dad's motives blah blah day forward to Dror missing his girls, wanting to give ""birthday present"". This distracts us completely to the fact that the girl he makes the cake for, is not his daughter, it's the cops daughter.  And it's not a birthday cake, it's a rape cake.  Up to and including all the torture, not once does Dror falter, not the viewer suspect him guilty.  I thought it was the father all along, and he was just twisted.  But once he left to dig up head,i knew it couldn't be him.  Then we find cops daughter is missing, can't be Dror, he's been in basement.  You never think back to the birthday cake scene, because it was set up to appear like it was his daughter, with bike in background and everything.  It's not until the final frame we see the secret room and the cops daughter unconscious in said room.  During the birthday cake sequence, all the men can be seen plotting their misdeeds, but because we've seen nothing ""bad"" from Dror, we just assume it's for good.  Dad tightening chair, cop packing taser, and pedophile drugging his victim.  I thought this was a fantastic movie.  I agree in spots the acting was a bit meh, but overall i thought it was well acted, and definitely kept me guessing till the end as far as what really took place.

I get the mother daughter thing, and some people can be really psycho and want to pray away the gay or even worse so MAYBE the mom wanted to lobotomize Nomi, but an entire hospital is there to back her up, she can't contact the outside world, she is trapped, etc. I get where the writers are coming from, especially with what the Wachowskis went through (and what you see Ms. Jenner go through), but I thought it was too venomous. Again, it could be totally called for, but it seems to generalize and I didn't like that...The sensate who gave birth to the sensates was being hunted down by a white male who seemed to relish in hunting down women (he really does, in fact he only hunts down the women, the men come to him).

My main issue is that at the end of season 1, after 10 hours of television, not much happened, so they'll either have to rush season 2 to get to a point where all the sensates are interacting with each other and are ready to face things together as a group (not just pairs).

We saw kickass get incredibly abused, hitgirl's entire childhood was being a tool to enact a parental vendetta, and in attempting said vendetta big daddy was burned to death in front of his daughter's eyes. There were flawed characters that each had arcs and endings.Kickass is a complete story (if you discount the very end scene which I can only imagine they left in there because $$$?).KA2 was an abomination. What growing up was there in the film? It didn't exploit the consequences of deranged superhero fantasies, it reveled in it. Just look at the poop gun scene and how fucking gratuitous it is. They revel in the fact that hitgirl is so cool with her superhero gadgets! Wouldn't you want a gun that could do that to those stupid queen bees in highschool?Speaking of which the cliche queen bee character was so fucking flat I could actually see the curvature of the earth. ""Queen Bee"" is an archtype specifically designed to manipulate the audience to hate the character. It is simply shitty writing. At the end of KA2 we see hitgirl go off as a loner batman type and kickass form the superhero awesome league or whatever. KA2 did the exact opposite of what you claimed it did. KA2 ended on a ""Fuck yeah thats awesome!"" and not a ""Grow the fuck up"". In fact, kickass 1 ended with the characters putting that life behind them and realizing that normality isn't necessarily better than the alternative.Your analysis of KA2 is so off that I would be convinced that you didn't see the movie (not to personally attack you, im sure you're a standup guy/gal).",10/8/2014 7:34,1,0,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

The reason it worked was that it updated it and took it in a way that was different yet still captured the charm. The others have tried to stay too true to the original and not update or do a new angle. Cinderella compared to maleficent is a great example of this. While Cinderella was very close to the original and was frankly meh, Maleficent was an interesting twist while still containing was what great about the characters. Cruella did the same but much like 101 Dalmatians is often overlooked. Once upon a time was a great series that gained a lot of audiences at the start by doing the same. They then did the whole season 4 frozen thing that was not the normal twist and saw audiences complain because it was too close. They wanted to see an evil elsa or at least a twist in some way. If you look too at what are being remade, it is those titles that can't been shown to kids due to the originals not aging well. This is so kids get to know their older characters. Aladdin, jungle book, mulan, and Dumbo all have warnings now due to a shift in what is seen as acceptable or straight up don't appear in the kids sections. Peter pan has a real issue type of remake with this and it is just not possible to do in such a way that they used a Tinkerbell and Jake and the Neverland pirates series instead. That's what they need to do in other ways but nostalgia in parents too comes into the equation. 101 Dalmatian street and the new takes on Mickey and co is proving popular but it not as far reaching due to the paywall that is having disney plus or cable/sky/virgin so don't make any where as much money. So not all are flops but they also aren't made for you or for the reason you might realise.

A lot of the female villains in the original films were in my opinion a little shallow they seemed to be evil for the sake of being evil and their motives seem more like excuses rather than actual reasons for their villiainry. For example: Maleficent. Cursing a baby just because her parents did not invite her to the christening? Very unfair and makes little sense (for our human brain at least). Cursing a baby because her father is a genocidal arsehole who has betrayed her and tailoring the curse as an echo to the the betrayal? Makes a lot more sense. Similarly, with Cruella, we get an actual explanation as to why she is not a 'nice' person. By this hypothesis, a good film to remake then would be The Little Mermaid but from Ursula's perspective. The reason why she was banished from the palace was never revealed in the films proper and it would be nice to see the events leading up to that. According to the stage musical, Ursula was supposed to rule the seas with King Triton but he eventually banished her because she used dark magic and was greedy. Well...what if that was wrong? What if the reason why Ursula was so keen to take back the throne was because she was the rightful ruler (or at least co ruler) of the sea and Triton kicked her out so he can have the kingdom for himself? There could be a subplot in which Ariel finds out that Ursula was the true Queen of the Sea and both help each other get what they want. Oh and I hope they don't remake The Hunchback of Notre Dame. That film is way too good. There is nothing to improve on.",1/1/2023 10:21,1,1,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

The animated movies is just Mowgli wandering around the jungle. I would also argue that Lady and the Tramp, Cinderella, and Pete and the Magic Dragon were also transformative enough to be decent movies, if not great. Lady and the Tramp is also mildly remarkable for its canine stars being shelter dogs trained for most of the stunts with cgi to make their faces more expressive, Same goes for Cruella and Maleficent, both of which were kinda silly but they were new perspectives on old stories.Starting around Beauty and the Beast reboot, they basically did color-by-number recreations, but usually with un-added flourishes added, most of those flourishes being crowdsourced from decades of internet nit-picks and theories. So it feels unoriginal, and made to address nit-picks, theories, and quibbles that middle the focus. Add fluff piece articles to make much ado of minimal strides towards representation (We made LaFou gay!!!) as cheap publicity, making Disney look desperate for even a scrap of good press. Mulan, while largely transformative, was made absolutely wrongheadedly, and was one of the three strikes that made China stop taking Disneys movies (which might actually be best in the long run).Some of these movies might have been salvageable if they had simply not tried to recapture the magic of the animated movies. Aladdin as essentially Hitch 2 but with magic would been easy money. Lion King as Shakespeare told through a nature documentary, complete with a narrator as Greek Chorus, would be interesting, and justify them adhering to photorealistic portrayals of the characters. If they had simply let Donnie Yen direct Mulan I guarantee it would at least be as fun to watch as a middling action movie with more than a few good action scenes. While watching Beauty and the Beast felt like someone slowly grind my brain against a brick wall in an attempt to paint it, giving Beast a whole song (Evermore) to sing was absolutely the right thing to do.",1/1/2023 7:01,0,,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

It reminds me a lot a 80s/90s movies which I really like. With stupid fast action, funny dialogues, nice cast (better cast has only Expendables, Star Trek and Ocean's) and popcorn plot with a great music and nice director's work. I really liked the first movie, third movie and for me the revolution begin with fifth, sixth, seventh movie, where I became a fan. I simply loved director's effort of Justin Lin, James Wan and F. Gary Gray. Those were NAMES. I also like side-characters and their actors like - Kurt Russel, Scott Eastwood, Jason Statham, The Rock (possibly his best role), Luke Evans or Tony Jaa. But something tells me, that they should've stop after the eight one. That was the biggest peak. I also really enjoy Hobbs and Shaw, which reminds me a lot a movies like Bad Boys, Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour. It was a really good movie, with also fantastic cast. Vanessa Kirby, Hellen Mirren, Idris Elba, Eiza Gonzales (and her scenes!!). Like a proper action flick. But from the moment F9 was announce I just felt that this isn't right. Justin Lin didn't succeed with Star Trek: Beyond (he killed that franchise) and coming back with a sterile film. This series did many thing wrong and crazy, impossible at least. But - they didn't ,,reviving characters just like that"". What they did with Han completely destroys this franchise for good. Leaving all the side characters outside was another ,,misstep"". And Vin Diesel as the only hero of this franchise is just ,,wrong"". The only replacement for Paul Walker should be Scott Eastwood or at least Statham maybe even The Rock. Not the melodrama between Vin and Michelle. And now, even Justin is gone and some no-name director directs the finale of the franchise. So sad. I really like the franchise to the eight entry. Now I cannot see it. Vin became worse than The Rock. And I was a fan of his project - Fast, Riddick, XXX and his vision for ,,Hannibal the Conqueror"".

Her buddy was presented as doing a terrible thing out of practical necessity, for the greater good.It was hugely arrogant of the film to try to convince us that torture was both abhorrent and sometimes genuinely necessary.  It utterly glossed over the hypocritical reservations that many Americans had.  As a matter of historical accuracy, the CIA consistently claimed their torture programs produced actionable intelligence in the hunt for Bin Laden.  A Senate investigation challenges that story, but that was the narrative.  The movie simply asks us to accept that it happened the way the CIA said, that the taliban were bad guys, and not to worry too much about the ethical implications.

I was honestly pretty surprised at how good this actually was. I watched it because I believe there are way too few Flash-centric movies and he was the best character in this. But every character had understandable arcs, motivations, and felt pretty real in their emotional states. The action is also pretty great, really well animated and the way they use all their superpowers was pretty inventive stuff I hadn't seen in a movie before. I'd say it's worth a watch, from what I can tell it's not connected to any universe of movies or anything so you don't need to watch like 5 other movies to get it, it's just a fun comic book movie, like they're really meant to be.",16/5/2021 17:17,1,1,,SUBJECTIVE,POSITIVE

The final heist/shootout is extremely intense especially for a GR film. Those gun shots sound so much louder and somehow more violent then say Die Hard or John Wick.
